    "description": "Gather and document the requirements for the APIDesignWorkshop platform, including the target audience, features, desired outcomes, and any relevant constraints or assumptions. Conduct stakeholder interviews, market research, and competitive analysis to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the project's goals and objectives. Identify the key stakeholders, such as developers, API consumers, and business stakeholders, and gather their input. Define the scope of the project, including the types of APIs (e.g., REST, GraphQL, WebSockets) and the industries or domains it will target. Outline the desired features and functionalities, such as API design tools, documentation generators, testing frameworks, and deployment options. Consider the platform's architecture, including the front-end, back-end, and database components. Identify any potential integration points with existing systems or third-party services. Establish the project's success criteria and key performance indicators (KPIs).",
