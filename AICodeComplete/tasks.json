Consider scalability, performance, fault tolerance, security, and maintainability aspects. Define the data flow and integration points between components. Provide a high-level diagram and detailed component descriptions, including technologies, frameworks, and design patterns to be used. Address potential challenges and mitigation strategies related to real-time code completion, model performance, handling large codebases, and model retraining/updates. Ensure the architecture supports incremental deployment and rollback strategies, as well as monitoring and logging capabilities for troubleshooting and performance analysis.",
