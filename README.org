* Builder Workspace

An experimental workspace for AI-assisted software development across multiple domains.

** Project Overview

The Builder Workspace leverages the BuilderAgents system to decompose projects into manageable tasks and coordinate their implementation. A small number of core projects receive direct human oversight, while others are autonomously managed by AI agents.

** Key Features

- Utilizes AI-driven project decomposition and implementation
- Employs the BuilderAgents system for task management and execution
- Supports a variety of project types and domains

** Workspace Structure

The workspace is organized as follows:

#+BEGIN_SRC text
builder-workspace/
├── Project1/
│   ├── project_info.json
│   └── tasks.json
├── Project2/
│   ├── project_info.json
│   └── tasks.json

└── pyproject.toml
#+END_SRC

** Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell :tangle no
git clone [repository_url]
cd builder-workspace
#+END_SRC

2. Set up the Python environment:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell :tangle no
poetry install
poetry shell
#+END_SRC

3. Review the BuilderAgents documentation to understand the AI-driven development process.

** Core Projects

The following projects are the primary focus of our current development efforts:

- BuilderAgents
- MultilinguaStoryForge
- BionicProsthesisNerve
- QuantumComputingSimulator
- AutonomousCombatVehicle

** Project Management

Each project in the workspace is managed through two key files:

- ~project_info.json~: Contains basic project information and description
- ~tasks.json~: Lists the tasks for the project, including their status, assignees, and dependencies

** BuilderAgents System

The BuilderAgents system provides:

- AI agents for project decomposition and task planning
- Automated code generation capabilities
- Testing and quality assurance tools
- Agent collaboration mechanisms

Refer to the BuilderAgents README.md for more detailed information on its usage and capabilities.

** Development Workflow

1. Focus on one of the core projects listed above
2. Review the project's ~project_info.json~ and ~tasks.json~ files
3. Use the BuilderAgents system to assist with task decomposition and implementation
4. Follow the development guidelines specified in the BuilderAgents documentation
5. Regularly review the progress of non-core projects for potential promotion to core status

** Contributing

Contributions to any project in the workspace are welcome. Please refer to the BuilderAgents developer guide for coding standards and contribution guidelines.
