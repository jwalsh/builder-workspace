    "description": "Design the overall system architecture, including components, interfaces, and data flow. Ensure scalability, maintainability, extensibility, and consider security, performance, error handling, and integration with existing systems or third-party services. The architecture should include the following components: a frontend user interface, a backend server, a solution generation engine, a solution explanation module, a database for storing solutions and user data, and an integration layer for third-party services (e.g., code execution environments, external knowledge bases). The architecture should follow a modular and layered approach, with clear separation of concerns and well-defined interfaces between components. Incorporate best practices for security, such as input validation, authentication, and authorization mechanisms. Consider performance optimizations, such as caching, load balancing, and asynchronous processing. Ensure proper error handling and logging mechanisms are in place. Provide for extensibility and scalability by designing loosely coupled components and using appropriate design patterns.",
