    "description": "Gather and document the project requirements, including the different theories of consciousness to be explored, the target audience, the desired user experience, the platform(s) to be supported (e.g., VR headsets, desktop VR), and any specific technical constraints or requirements. Additionally, consider the following aspects: (1) Identify the subject matter experts or consultants who can provide guidance on the theories of consciousness to be covered. (2) Determine the level of detail and accuracy required for the simulations and thought experiments. (3) Decide on the overall structure and flow of the experience, including the sequence of modules or levels. (4) Define the user interface and interaction methods that will be intuitive and immersive for the target audience. (5) Outline the data requirements, such as storing user progress, preferences, and any generated content. (6) Define the project's scope, timeline, and budget constraints. (7) Identify potential risks and mitigation strategies. (8) Determine the required team composition and roles.",
