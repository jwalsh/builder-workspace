Consider the following aspects:\n\n- Client-side architecture (mobile app): Modular design, separation of concerns, UI/UX considerations, performance optimizations, support for different device configurations, and adherence to accessibility standards.\n- Server-side architecture: Scalable and fault-tolerant design, microservices or monolithic approach, API design with proper documentation and versioning, data storage strategy considering both SQL and NoSQL databases, and serverless functions where applicable.\n- Communication protocols and data formats for client-server communication, considering RESTful APIs and gRPC for performance-critical operations.\n- Integration with external services: APIs, authentication, and data caching mechanisms like Redis or Memcached.\n- Security considerations: Data encryption using TLS, user authentication and authorization mechanisms like OAuth2, JWT, and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).\n- Deployment and infrastructure requirements: Cloud deployment on AWS or Google Cloud Platform, containerization with Docker and Kubernetes, and continuous integration/deployment (CI/CD) pipelines using Jenkins or GitLab CI.\n- Document the architecture design in technical documents and diagrams for easy understanding and maintenance.",
