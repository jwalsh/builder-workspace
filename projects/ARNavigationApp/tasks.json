    "description": "Design the overall system architecture for the ARNavigationApp, including the client-server model, data flow, and integration with external services. Consider the following aspects:\n\n- Client-side architecture (mobile app): Modular design, separation of concerns, UI/UX considerations, performance optimizations, support for different device configurations, and adherence to accessibility standards.\n- Server-side architecture: Scalable and fault-tolerant design, microservices or monolithic approach, API design with proper documentation and versioning, data storage strategy considering both SQL and NoSQL databases, and serverless functions where applicable. Include the use of containerization technology like Docker and Kubernetes for deployment on AWS or Google Cloud Platform.\n- Communication protocols and data formats for client-server communication, considering RESTful APIs and gRPC for performance-critical operations. Consider using GraphQL for flexible API endpoints.\n- Integration with external services: APIs, authentication, and data caching mechanisms like Redis or Memcached.\n- Security considerations: Data encryption using TLS, user authentication and authorization mechanisms like OAuth2, JWT, and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). Implement secure communication channels for API calls and database connections.\n- Deployment and infrastructure requirements: Cloud deployment on AWS or Google Cloud Platform, containerization with Docker and Kubernetes, and continuous integration/deployment (CI/CD) pipelines using Jenkins or GitLab CI. Consider implementing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using tools like Terraform.\n- Document the architecture design in technical documents and diagrams for easy understanding and maintenance.",
