    "description": "Design the overall system architecture for the ARNavigationApp, including the client-server model, data flow, and integration with external services. Consider the following aspects:\n\n- Client-side architecture (mobile app): Modular design, separation of concerns, UI/UX considerations, performance optimizations, support for different device configurations, adherence to accessibility standards, implementation of MVVM or similar architectural pattern, and use of libraries like React Native for cross-platform development.\n- Server-side architecture: Scalable and fault-tolerant design, microservices approach using technologies like Node.js or Django, API design with proper documentation and versioning (Swagger or OpenAPI), data storage strategy considering both SQL (PostgreSQL) and NoSQL databases (MongoDB), and serverless functions where applicable. Include the use of containerization technology like Docker and Kubernetes for deployment on AWS or Google Cloud Platform, and consider using managed services like AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions.\n- Communication protocols and data formats for client-server communication, considering RESTful APIs, gRPC for performance-critical operations, and GraphQL for flexible API endpoints. Use Protocol Buffers for gRPC communication.\n- Integration with external services: APIs, authentication (OAuth2 for user authentication and authorization, JWT for token-based authentication), and data caching mechanisms like Redis or Memcached. Consider using RBAC for access control.\n- Security considerations: Data encryption using TLS, secure communication channels for API calls and database connections, and implementation of HTTPS. Use HMAC or OAuth2 token validation methods to ensure secure communication.\n- Deployment and infrastructure requirements: Cloud deployment on AWS or Google Cloud Platform, containerization with Docker and Kubernetes, Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using tools like Terraform, and continuous integration/deployment (CI/CD) pipelines using Jenkins or GitLab CI. Use Git version control for code management.\n- Document the architecture design in technical documents and diagrams for easy understanding and maintenance. Assign the task to the 'task-decomposer' role for further decomposition.\n",

Consideration of offline functionality (using SQLite and Service Workers) should be ensured. Performance optimization will focus on scalability, flexibility to accommodate future updates, and secure coding practices in data storage. Preliminary research into database sharding strategies for scalability is required, focusing specifically on partitioning methods suitable for our use case. Data privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA must also be considered, with solutions prioritizing anonymization techniques where possible. The selected solutions should prioritize security, efficiency, user experience, and compliance with these regulations. Upon completion of the preliminary research and design phase, a detailed report will be prepared for review by the project manager and the code-architect. Once approved, the task can be further decomposed into subtasks for implementation by the assigned team members. The rfc_state field should be updated to 'APPROVED_FOR_DESIGN'.",
