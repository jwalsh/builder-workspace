The types of code improvements to be suggested (e.g., variable naming conventions, method consolidation, dead code removal, etc.).\n2. The level of automation desired (semi-automatic or fully automatic).\n3. The programming languages and frameworks to be supported.\n4. Integration with existing development tools and workflows (e.g., IDEs, CI/CD pipelines).\n5. Expected performance and scalability requirements for the system.\n6. Security and compliance considerations (e.g., data privacy, secure coding practices, and adherence to industry standards).\n7. Edge cases, error handling mechanisms, and performance optimizations to be considered.\n8. Testing strategies for ensuring the quality of suggestions made by the AI.",
