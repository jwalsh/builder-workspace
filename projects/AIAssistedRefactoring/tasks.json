    "description": "Gather and document the detailed requirements for the AI-assisted refactoring system, including:\n1. The types of code improvements to be suggested (e.g., variable naming conventions, method consolidation, dead code removal, etc.).\n2. The level of automation desired (semi-automatic or fully automatic).\n3. The programming languages and frameworks to be supported.\n4. Integration with existing development tools and workflows (e.g., IDEs, CI/CD pipelines), providing a list of specific tools to support.\n5. Expected performance and scalability requirements for the system, specifying the performance benchmarks and scaling scenarios.\n6. Security and compliance considerations (e.g., data privacy, secure coding practices, and adherence to industry standards), specifically emphasizing on potential vulnerabilities and how they will be mitigated, including a detailed security plan.\n7. Edge cases, error handling mechanisms, and performance optimizations to be considered, with a focus on edge cases that might be specific to AI-driven refactoring and their proposed solutions.\n8. Testing strategies for ensuring the quality of suggestions made by the AI, outlining the methods and tools to be used for testing (unit tests, integration tests, etc.).\n9. Documentation requirements for the system, including user guides, API documentation, and developer guides, specifying the format and level of detail required.\n10. Identify key stakeholders for feedback and collaboration in the development process.",
