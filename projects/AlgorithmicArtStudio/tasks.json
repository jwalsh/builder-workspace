    "description": "Gather and document comprehensive requirements for the AlgorithmicArtStudio platform. This includes features, user stories, technical specifications, and non-functional requirements such as performance, scalability, security, accessibility, and maintainability. The requirements should cater to various user roles (learners, instructors, administrators), considering their respective needs. In addition, the requirements document should outline the interaction between these roles for a seamless user experience. This task will be further divided into the following sub-tasks: 1. Gather functional and non-functional requirements, 2. Define user stories, 3. Document technical specifications, 4. Establish performance, scalability, security, accessibility, and maintainability standards, and 5. Collaborate with relevant stakeholders to validate and refine the requirements document. Upon completion of these sub-tasks, this task will be considered complete.",
