    "description": "Gather and document comprehensive requirements for the AlgorithmicArtStudio platform. This includes features, user stories, technical specifications, and non-functional requirements such as performance, scalability, security, accessibility, and maintainability. The requirements should cater to various user roles (learners, instructors, administrators), considering their respective needs. In addition, the requirements document should outline the interaction between these roles for a seamless user experience. This task will be further divided into the following sub-tasks: 1. Gather functional and non-functional requirements, 2. Define user stories, 3. Document technical specifications, 4. Establish performance, scalability, security, accessibility, and maintainability standards, 5. Collaborate with relevant stakeholders to validate and refine the requirements document, and 6. Provide clear guidelines for developers (frontend and backend) regarding the implementation of these requirements. Upon completion of these sub-tasks, this task will be considered complete. To ensure a holistic approach, it is recommended that team members from different roles participate in the validation process to cover all perspectives. This task is currently in progress.",
