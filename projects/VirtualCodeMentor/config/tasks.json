    "description": "Revise and expand the project requirements as follows: \n1. Gather and document the project requirements, including features (e.g., adaptive learning, real-time feedback, progress tracking), user personas (beginners, intermediate, advanced programmers, and professionals), learning styles (visual, auditory, kinesthetic), coding challenge types (problem solving, debugging, coding quizzes, and coding practices), integration with existing development platforms (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket), non-functional requirements such as performance, scalability, security, accessibility, usability, and the system architecture (frontend, backend, AI component, and database) and the data model. Additionally, consider the need for a feedback mechanism that incorporates user's preferences and learning pace, a feature to track collaboration between users, a method for adapting to new coding languages and frameworks, and an option for user-defined custom challenges. \n2. For each requirement, specify acceptance criteria to ensure that the development team can deliver against the requirements. \n3. Outline the system's monitoring and logging capabilities, focusing on real-time analytics, error reporting, and performance metrics. \n4. Consider integration with popular AI tools (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) for machine learning and natural language processing tasks. \n5. Document any potential risks or challenges associated with the project, along with proposed mitigation strategies. ",
