    "description": "Gather and document all requirements for the EmpathyAmplifierDevice, including target user groups (initially adults aged 18-65, with potential expansion to children and elderly), desired features (emotional state sharing, real-time feedback, privacy settings, etc.), technical constraints (device compatibility, battery life, connectivity, etc.), ethical considerations (data use, consent, mental health impact, etc.), data privacy and security requirements (compliance with GDPR, HIPAA, and other relevant regulations), regulatory compliance (FCC, CE, RoHS, etc.), potential risks and mitigation strategies (unintended emotional contagion, device loss or theft, etc.). Additionally, consider the user experience design for easy navigation and operation. This will include wireframing and prototyping for various interfaces. Once the scope and requirements are defined, they will be used to guide the design, development, and testing phases of the project. The task will be reassigned to the appropriate team members for further decomposition.\nThe task has been reviewed and updated with an emphasis on user experience design considerations and the addition of wireframing and prototyping tasks. It is now ready for the next state.",
