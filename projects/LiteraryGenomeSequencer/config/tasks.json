    "description": "Provide a comprehensive outline of the project's scope, objectives, and technical requirements. This encompasses detailing the types of literary works to be analyzed (e.g., novels, short stories, plays, poetry, speeches), the preferred output format (structured data, visualizations, or both), the desired level of accuracy and detail, specific features such as genre classification, author identification, theme analysis, character analysis, sentiment analysis, plot structure detection, and any other necessary functionalities. Also, specify the user interface requirements (mobile and web versions, multiple language support), API endpoints, database schema (including data normalization and indexing strategies), security considerations (data privacy, authentication, and authorization mechanisms), testing procedures, performance benchmarks, scalability plans, disaster recovery strategies, and error handling strategies. Include a discussion on the machine learning algorithms to be used for text analysis and natural language processing. Furthermore, define the interface for user input and interaction, such as uploading files or copy-pasting text. Also, consider the accessibility of the application for users with different abilities. Lastly, update the task status to 'APPROVED FOR NEXT STATE' when the review is complete.",

The strategy should consider a wide range of genres, authors, edge cases, accuracy, reliability, and robustness of the system. To ensure effective testing, include test cases for uncommon genres, diverse author styles, and outlier data. Implement regression testing to maintain system performance post-implementation. Focus on corner cases in genres where our model may not have significant data for training. Detailed documentation should be provided for each test case, the expected outcome, and any known issues or limitations. The metrics for evaluating test success and failure should be clearly defined. As the model development progresses and more data becomes available, update the strategy accordingly. To facilitate clear communication, write detailed documentation and make it accessible to all team members.",
