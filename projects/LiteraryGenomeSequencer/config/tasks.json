    "title": "Define Project Scope and Requirements - Reworked",
    "description": "The revised project scope and requirements outline provides a comprehensive understanding of the LiteraryGenomeSequencer. This includes analyzing various literary works (e.g., novels, short stories, plays, poetry, speeches), delivering output in both structured data and visualization formats, maintaining a high level of accuracy and detail. The following features are specified: genre classification, author identification, theme analysis, character analysis, sentiment analysis, plot structure detection, and additional functionalities as necessary. User interface requirements consist of mobile and web versions, multi-language support, API endpoints, databases with data normalization and indexing strategies, robust security measures (including data privacy, authentication, and authorization mechanisms), testing procedures, performance benchmarks, scalability plans, disaster recovery strategies, and error handling strategies. The machine learning algorithms to be used for text analysis and natural language processing will be discussed in a separate RFC. User input interface will support file uploads and text copy-pasting, with due consideration for accessibility for users with different abilities. Upon completion of the review, update the task status to 'APPROVED FOR NEXT STATE'.",

    "description": "Develop a robust testing strategy that encompasses unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests, and performance tests for the AI model. The strategy should consider a wide range of genres, authors, edge cases, accuracy, reliability, and robustness of the system. To ensure effective testing, include test cases for uncommon genres, diverse author styles, and outlier data. Implement regression testing to maintain system performance post-implementation. Focus on corner cases in genres where our model may not have significant data for training. Detailed documentation should be provided for each test case, the expected outcome, and any known issues or limitations. The metrics for evaluating test success and failure should be clearly defined. As the model development progresses and more data becomes available, update the strategy accordingly. To facilitate clear communication, write detailed documentation and make it accessible to all team members. In addition, consider using a testing framework that supports parallel execution for faster testing cycles. Also, consider setting up test coverage goals (e.g., 80% line coverage) to ensure thorough testing. Finally, prioritize creating test data generation scripts to simulate various literary genres and author styles. Update the strategy to address these points.",
