    "description": "Comprehensively gather, document, and organize the requirements for the IncidentResponseOrchestrator platform. Detailed requirements should cover: types of incidents it should handle, integration with relevant tools and teams, automation and orchestration workflows, specific security, compliance, or regulatory requirements, as well as user stories and use cases demonstrating usage in various scenarios. The document should also elucidate the technical architecture and APIs for seamless integration. To ensure clarity, break down the requirements into manageable sections, categorize them, and provide examples where necessary.\n\nFor this RFC to move forward, consider addressing the following points: \n1. Define clear use cases for each incident type (e.g., network outage, ransomware attack, DDoS attack).\n2. Identify specific tools and teams that the platform should integrate with.\n3. Detail automation and orchestration workflows, including the sequence of actions for each incident type.\n4. Address any security, compliance, or regulatory requirements.\n5. List API endpoints required for integration and provide documentation on their expected usage.",
