    "description": "Clearly define the scope of NeuralDataCompressor, focusing on its primary use cases: data compression and storage for neural patterns. Detail the desired functionalities, which include efficient compression algorithms, scalability, compatibility with various neural network architectures (such as Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, and Autoencoders), and real-time data processing capabilities. Identify key performance indicators (KPIs) for measuring success, such as compression ratio, speed of compression/decompression, memory usage, system stability under heavy load, energy efficiency, and latency. Include support for popular machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and MXNet in the compatibility list. Additionally, consider integrating data visualization tools for better understanding and interpretation of compressed data. Update the task to emphasize the need for modular design for easier integration with existing systems. Lastly, discuss potential security considerations and solutions.",
