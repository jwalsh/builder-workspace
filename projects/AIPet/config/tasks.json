The plan should cover unit testing, integration testing, system testing, user acceptance testing, and performance testing. Break down each test type into manageable subtasks (e.g., create a separate subtask for each major functionality to be tested). For each subtask, provide clear test cases, expected outcomes, and a timeline. The plan should address both functional (e.g., functionality, usability) and non-functional aspects of the project (e.g., security, scalability, reliability). Collaborate with relevant team members to ensure comprehensive coverage and consistency in testing methodologies. Once completed, submit the testing plan for review and approval by the Project Manager. Upon approval, begin execution of the test plan. To improve clarity, it is suggested to break down each test type into more specific subtasks (e.g., separate subtasks for unit tests on robot movement, unit tests on AI functionality, etc.). This will help in better understanding and tracking of tasks.",
