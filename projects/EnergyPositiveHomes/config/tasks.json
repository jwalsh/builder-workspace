Consider scalability, maintainability, performance requirements, high availability, and security concerns related to energy data, user information, and communication with external systems. Incorporate monitoring, logging, and alerting mechanisms for system health and performance. Additionally, consider the use of microservices architecture for better modularity, extensibility, and fault tolerance. Ensure that the design is future-proof and can easily accommodate new technologies or changes in requirements. This task includes the following subtasks: Detailed Component Design, API Design, and Security and Privacy Considerations. Upon completion, pass the design to the assigned team for implementation. After implementation, perform a code review before deployment.",

This includes energy consumption, production, and storage metrics. The system should support real-time data ingestion, historical data storage, and advanced analytics capabilities. Emphasize on data integrity, fault tolerance, and high availability. Implement appropriate data partitioning and sharding strategies to handle large volumes of data. Consider using a combination of time-series database (e.g., InfluxDB, OpenTSDB) for real-time data and a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) for structured data storage. Ensure data backup and recovery mechanisms are robust. Integrate with an existing data analytics platform (e.g., PowerBI, Tableau) or develop custom analytics modules for generating insights and reports. Ensure compliance with relevant data privacy regulations. Collaborate with the team to finalize the design, then share it for review and validation. Once the design is finalized, start the implementation phase.",
