Consider scalability, maintainability, performance requirements, and high availability. Address security and privacy concerns related to energy data, user information, and communication with external systems. Incorporate monitoring, logging, and alerting mechanisms for system health and performance. Additionally, consider the use of microservices architecture for better modularity, extensibility, and fault tolerance. Also, ensure that the design is future-proof and can easily accommodate new technologies or changes in requirements.",

Implement appropriate data partitioning and sharding strategies to handle large volumes of data. Consider using a time-series database or a combination of relational and NoSQL databases based on the data structure and query patterns. Implement robust data backup and recovery mechanisms. Integrate with a data analytics platform or develop custom analytics modules for generating insights and reports.",
