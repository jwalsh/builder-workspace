    "description": "Gather and document comprehensive requirements for the CrossLingualDocSynchronizer tool, addressing: supported languages, translation and adaptation strategies (consider Neural Machine Translation, rule-based systems, human review), integration with existing documentation systems, UI/UX specifications, data storage and retrieval mechanisms (consider scalable solutions like NoSQL databases), security considerations (include encryption, access controls, and user authentication), scalability and performance requirements, edge cases (such as handling obscure or uncommon phrases), error handling strategies, performance optimizations, and deployment strategies. Provide clear documentation for each requirement with examples when necessary. Include non-functional requirements such as maintainability, modularity, and ease of extensibility.",
