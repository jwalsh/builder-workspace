    "description": "Gather and document comprehensive requirements for the CrossLingualDocSynchronizer tool, addressing: supported languages (initially English, Spanish, Mandarin, German, French, and Japanese), translation and adaptation strategies (utilize a combination of Neural Machine Translation, rule-based systems, and human review when necessary), integration with existing documentation systems (such as Doxygen, Javadoc, Sphinx, etc.), UI/UX specifications (follow modern design principles for simplicity, accessibility, and intuitiveness), data storage and retrieval mechanisms (NoSQL databases like MongoDB or Couchbase for scalability), security considerations (include AES-256 encryption, role-based access control, OAuth2.0 for user authentication, and secure communication channels), scalability and performance requirements (able to handle 10,000 documents per minute with minimal latency), edge cases (handle rare or uncommon phrases by using a custom dictionary and contextual understanding), error handling strategies (gracefully handle common errors like network timeouts, translation service failures, and document format incompatibilities), performance optimizations (use caching for frequent data retrieval, minify and compress code and assets, and utilize CDN for faster content delivery), deployment strategies (Docker-based containerization for easy deployment on various platforms like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud). Provide clear documentation for each requirement with examples when necessary. Include non-functional requirements such as maintainability, modularity, and ease of extensibility. Update the 'assigned_to' field to 'code-architect'.",
