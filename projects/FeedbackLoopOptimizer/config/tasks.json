User authentication using industry-standard protocols (e.g., OAuth, OpenID Connect) and secure password storage (e.g., salted and hashed with bcrypt).\n2. Role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to sensitive data and functionality based on user roles and permissions, implementing least privilege principle.\n3. Data encryption at rest (e.g., using AES-256 in XTS mode) and in transit (e.g., using TLS/SSL with forward secrecy).\n4. Secure communication channels (e.g., HTTPS over QUIC) for all data transmissions.\n5. Regular security audits, penetration testing, and vulnerability assessments to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.\n6. Adherence to relevant security standards and best practices (e.g., OWASP Top Ten, NIST SP 800-53).\n7. Implement a secure logging mechanism for audit trails and incident response. In addition, consider implementing multi-factor authentication and regular security training for users.\n8. Ensure the system complies with all applicable privacy laws and regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).",
