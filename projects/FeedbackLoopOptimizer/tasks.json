Address data privacy concerns, comply with relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR), plan for potential scalability issues by considering future growth, and provide documentation for each component of the system architecture. Consider involving the Data Privacy Officer in discussions regarding user data handling to ensure compliance.",

Role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to sensitive data and functionality based on user roles and permissions, implementing least privilege principle.\n3. Data encryption at rest (e.g., using AES-256 in XTS mode) and in transit (e.g., using TLS/SSL with forward secrecy).\n4. Secure communication channels (e.g., HTTPS over QUIC) for all data transmissions.\n5. Regular security audits, penetration testing, and vulnerability assessments to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.\n6. Adherence to relevant security standards and best practices (e.g., OWASP Top Ten, NIST SP 800-53).\n7. Implement a secure logging mechanism for audit trails and incident response.",
