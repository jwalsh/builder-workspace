Data encryption at rest (e.g., using AES-256) and in transit (e.g., using TLS/SSL) to protect feedback data.\n4. Secure communication channels (e.g., HTTPS) for all data transmissions.\n5. Regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.\n6. Adherence to relevant security standards and best practices (e.g., OWASP, NIST).",
