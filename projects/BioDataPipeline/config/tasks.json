    "description": "Thoroughly revise and update the detailed requirements for the BioDataPipeline project, including data types (e.g., genomic, imaging), sources, security needs (e.g., encryption methods such as AES-256 and RSA, access controls, multi-factor authentication, data anonymization methods like k-anonymity or l-diversity), performance requirements (latency, throughput, scalability), user workflows, integration with existing systems (API documentation needed, including Swagger for REST APIs and Postman for interactive testing), scalability considerations (horizontal and vertical scaling strategies, auto-scaling mechanisms like AWS Auto Scaling Groups), compliance with relevant regulations (HIPAA, GDPR, CCPA), data retention policies, disaster recovery plans, and detailed design for the overall system architecture (including microservices architecture, containerization using Docker and Kubernetes, orchestration with Kubernetes, and service meshes like Istio for communication between services). The revised document should also address testing strategies (unit testing, integration testing, performance testing), deployment strategies (continuous integration/continuous deployment with tools like Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes), maintenance strategies (monitoring using Prometheus and alerting using Alertmanager), and documentation strategies (using Markdown or Doxygen for code comments, and Sphinx for generating project documentation). The revised document should also provide a timeline for the completion of each requirement. If necessary, break down the task into smaller subtasks and assign them to appropriate team members. The final document will be reviewed by the security specialist, technical writer, and project manager.",
