    "title": "Design System Architecture for FeedbackTranslator: Revised",
    "description": "This RFC outlines the system architecture design for the FeedbackTranslator project. The design encompasses the following components, data flow, integration points, and infrastructure requirements: user interface, natural language processing (NLP), machine learning models, data storage, deployment environment, scalability, security, and monitoring/logging. Each component is broken down into tasks detailing their integration with one another. The user interface design will prioritize accessibility and ease-of-use, while the NLP component will leverage state-of-the-art models for feedback interpretation. Machine learning models will be trained on a diverse dataset to ensure broad applicability. Data storage will utilize secure, scalable solutions, and the deployment environment will be designed for efficiency and flexibility. The design also includes provisions for monitoring/logging, with regular audits scheduled to maintain security and performance.",
