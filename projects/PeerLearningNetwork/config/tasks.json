    "description": "Design the overall system architecture, including the frontend, backend, database, and any necessary integrations or third-party services. Consider the following aspects:\n\n1. Scalability: The platform should be able to handle a growing number of users and content without compromising performance.\n\n2. Modularity: The architecture should be modular, with clear separation of concerns and well-defined interfaces between components.\n\n3. Security: Implement appropriate security measures to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.\n\n4. Maintainability: The codebase should be well-organized, documented, and follow best practices for maintainability.\n\n5. Integration: Identify any necessary integrations with existing systems or third-party services (e.g., authentication, notifications, content management). Consider using OAuth for authentication to ensure secure user access.\n\n6. Data Storage: Determine the appropriate database solution(s) based on the data requirements and access patterns. Consider using a combination of SQL and NoSQL databases for optimal performance.\n\n7. Caching: Explore caching strategies to improve performance and reduce load on the database. Consider implementing an effective cache invalidation strategy to ensure data consistency.\n\n8. Monitoring and Logging: Incorporate mechanisms for monitoring system health, performance, and logging for debugging and auditing purposes. Use tools like Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring and ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for logging.\n\n9. Performance Optimization: Consider optimizing the frontend by using techniques such as lazy loading, code splitting, and minification to improve initial load times and reduce bandwidth usage.\n\n10. Mobile Compatibility: The platform should be mobile-friendly and responsive, providing a seamless experience across various devices.",
