Identify key components, their interactions, and the technologies/frameworks to be used (e.g., microservices, real-time data processing capabilities using Apache Kafka or Amazon Kinesis, databases like PostgreSQL for structured data and Elasticsearch for search and analytics), ensuring seamless integration across various customer touchpoints (websites, mobile apps, APIs). Incorporate data privacy and security considerations, emphasizing GDPR and CCPA compliance. The design should include provisions for disaster recovery and regular system maintenance. Additionally, outline the data flow, storage solutions, real-time processing technologies, and discuss how these components will work together to meet the performance and scalability requirements.\r\nIncorporate newline characters as needed for proper formatting.",
