    "description": "Revise the overall system architecture design for TrafficInspector, including a detailed breakdown of distributed components, communication protocols, data flow, scalability considerations, and security measures. The revised design should also provide clear guidelines for interoperability between different VPCs, ensure efficient use of backend security appliances, and take into account the need for flexibility to accommodate future updates and expansions. Additionally, consider the impact on performance and propose potential optimization strategies.",

The revised plan should prioritize high availability, scalability, fault tolerance, and resilience. Identify suitable monitoring tools for system health, performance, and security tracking. Determine the necessary infrastructure components including load balancers, databases, caching layers, and other relevant elements. Utilize containerization and microservices architecture for enhanced scalability and consider implementing a serverless approach where appropriate. Address data privacy and security concerns through encryption, access controls, and regular audits. Include strategies for handling system updates, disaster recovery, and scaling the infrastructure as necessary. Suggest potential tools or services for each component based on industry best practices and current technological trends.",
