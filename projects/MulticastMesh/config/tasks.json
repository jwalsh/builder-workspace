    "description": "Thoroughly update the project requirements documentation with detailed descriptions of the multicast applications to be built (including specific functionalities, such as application architecture, supported protocols, error handling, etc.), the virtual private clouds and accounts to be integrated (with their respective regions, services, and any necessary access configurations), the external multicast services to be used (including API documentation or relevant links, along with details about service integration methods), expected performance and scalability requirements (including benchmarks if available), security and compliance considerations (including required certifications, data protection strategies, and incident response plans), any assumptions or constraints, and other relevant details. Address any gaps in the original requirements. Provide a clear timeline for completion of each deliverable, and identify key milestones. Also, document any potential risks, mitigation strategies, and contingency plans. Upon completion, conduct a peer review to ensure alignment with project goals and industry best practices. If necessary, collaborate with other team members or external stakeholders to gather missing information. Once approved, update the rfc_state field accordingly. The assigned_to field remains 'code-architect' for this task.",

The design should address the following aspects: 1) Scalability and load balancing to handle increasing multicast traffic, 2) Fault tolerance and high availability, 3) Security considerations for data transmission and access control (with emphasis on encryption and authentication), 4) Monitoring and logging mechanisms (including real-time monitoring and alert systems), 5) Integration with external multicast services and VPCs/accounts, 6) Document the architecture design in a clear and concise manner for effective communication with other team members. Additionally, consider the need for modularity to facilitate future updates and extensions. The final document should be structured according to architectural patterns and best practices.",
