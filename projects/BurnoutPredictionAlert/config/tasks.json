    "description": "Collect and document detailed requirements for the BurnoutPredictionAlert system. Prioritize the following areas: data sources (e.g., work hours logs, task assignments, deadlines, user feedback), prediction models (e.g., machine learning algorithms with clear explanation of their applications in this context, training datasets with examples of different work patterns leading to burnout and potential recovery patterns), user interface (e.g., dashboard, notifications with customizable thresholds and frequency, clear instructions on how to interpret the data provided), alert mechanisms (e.g., email, push notifications, in-app alerts, SMS, clearly defined scenarios for triggering each type of alert), integration requirements for possible external APIs or systems (specify which APIs are necessary and what functionality they provide), user feedback mechanism (to gather continuous input on the system's effectiveness), data security considerations (compliance with GDPR, HIPAA, or other relevant privacy regulations, secure storage of sensitive data), performance optimization strategies (to ensure the system runs smoothly even under high load). Ensure the requirements are clearly defined and include any necessary specifications such as API endpoints, data structures, and security considerations. The gathered requirements will facilitate an efficient development process.",

    "description": "Design the overall architecture of the system, including components, data flow, integration points, and key considerations for maintainability, scalability, and performance. The architecture should include the following components: 1) Data Collection: Mechanisms to collect user work patterns, schedules, and other relevant data, focusing on privacy and consent (to be discussed in detail during the 'Gather Requirements' task). 2) Data Processing: Pipelines for cleaning, transforming, and preparing data for model training while ensuring data quality and consistency. 3) Machine Learning Model: A predictive model to identify potential burnout based on the processed data, with a focus on accuracy, explainability, and bias mitigation. 4) Intervention Engine: A component to generate personalized suggestions and interventions based on the model's predictions, considering user preferences and feedback loops for continuous improvement. 5) User Interface: A web or mobile application for users to interact with the system, view predictions, and receive suggestions. The UI design should prioritize usability, accessibility, and intuitive navigation. 6) Monitoring and Alerting: Mechanisms to monitor system health, performance, and data quality, including alerting for potential issues and anomalies. Additionally, consider incorporating a logging system for debugging and troubleshooting purposes. 7) Documentation: Comprehensive documentation of the system architecture, components, and their interactions (to be handled by the 'Technical Writer').",
