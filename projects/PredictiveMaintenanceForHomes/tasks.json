    "description": "Review and refine the project requirements, ensuring they are comprehensive and detailed. The updated requirements should include: home systems to be monitored (e.g., HVAC, plumbing, electrical), maintenance prediction algorithms (e.g., machine learning models, rule-based systems, and their specific use cases), user interfaces (web, mobile app, and their design guidelines for accessibility and usability), integration with external services (repair scheduling, energy providers, smart home devices, and API documentation for seamless communication), and data privacy and security considerations. Additionally, consider the long-term scalability of the project for potential future expansions.",
