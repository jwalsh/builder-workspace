    "description": "Review and refine the project requirements, ensuring they are comprehensive and detailed. The updated requirements should include: home systems to be monitored (e.g., HVAC, plumbing, electrical), maintenance prediction algorithms (specific use cases could include predictive modeling for machine learning models, rule-based systems, and their integration, as well as discussing potential AI/ML libraries or frameworks that may be suitable), user interfaces (web, mobile app, and their design guidelines should emphasize accessibility, usability, and responsiveness across various devices), integration with external services (repair scheduling, energy providers, smart home devices, and API documentation for seamless communication should be considered, along with discussing potential APIs or protocols to use), data privacy and security considerations (including data encryption, secure data storage, and user authentication/authorization mechanisms), and long-term scalability of the project for potential future expansions. Additionally, consider the implications of integrating our system with existing smart home platforms like Amazon Alexa, Google Home, or Apple HomeKit. Lastly, ensure that the requirements document is clearly organized and easy to understand by all team members.",
