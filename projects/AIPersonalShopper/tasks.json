    "description": "Design the overall system architecture, including components, data flow, and integration points. The architecture should consider scalability, fault tolerance, and security best practices. Identify the key components such as the recommendation engine, user preference management, data ingestion and processing pipelines, and e-commerce platform integrations. Outline the high-level data flow and interactions between components. Propose appropriate technologies and frameworks for each component based on their requirements and constraints. Additionally, consider the following aspects: 1) Data storage and management for user preferences, product catalogs, and recommendation models. 2) Microservices architecture for better scalability and maintainability. 3) Containerization and orchestration for deployment and management. 4) Monitoring, logging, and error handling mechanisms. 5) Security considerations like authentication, authorization, and data encryption.",
