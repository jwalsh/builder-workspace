    "description": "Gather and document the detailed requirements for the Federated Learning Framework. These should include data privacy considerations (such as differential privacy, secure multi-party computation, federated-averaging algorithms), target platforms (mobile, IoT, edge computing), performance goals (e.g., model accuracy, latency, memory usage, energy efficiency), scalability requirements (number of devices and data size, handling large scale distributed training), security measures (encryption, access controls, secure storage solutions), APIs or interfaces required for integration with other systems (RESTful API, gRPC, SDKs), potential use cases and scenarios where the framework could be applied (real-time anomaly detection, personalized recommendation systems, etc.). Additionally, consider the trade-offs between privacy, performance, and utility. Provide examples of real-world applications that can benefit from this framework.",
