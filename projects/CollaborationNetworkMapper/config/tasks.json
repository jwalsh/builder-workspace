    "description": "Gather and document comprehensive requirements for the CollaborationNetworkMapper system. This includes identifying data sources (both internal and external APIs), specifying desired outputs, detailing any specific constraints or assumptions, outlining potential integration points with other systems. Additionally, consider the scalability, security, and privacy requirements of the project, focusing on real-time processing capabilities to ensure timely collaboration network analysis. Also, outline a strategy for handling large datasets efficiently. Consider using big data technologies like Hadoop or Spark for this purpose. Lastly, specify the format and frequency of reports or visualizations to be generated, including possible interactive features and customization options. Additionally, explore potential use cases beyond simple collaboration network analysis, such as sentiment analysis of communication channels.",
