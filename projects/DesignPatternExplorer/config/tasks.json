    "description": "Gathered and documented preliminary project requirements, including a list of initial design patterns to be covered (e.g., Singleton, Strategy, Observer), desired features such as real-time feedback, progress tracking, interactive examples, target audience from beginner to advanced software developers, and relevant constraints or assumptions like limited bandwidth for some users and mobile compatibility. Conducted research and stakeholder interviews to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the project goals and user needs. Defined the project scope, including the platforms (web-based, potential mobile app, desktop app), integration requirements with existing systems or third-party services, and potential scalability concerns. Suggestions for initial design patterns and features have been included but encourage further discussion and refinement during the development phase. It is recommended to assign this task to the code-architect to review the project scope, requirements, and potential design patterns in detail before moving forward. To move forward, I suggest updating the current state of this RFC to 'READY_FOR_CODE_ARCHITECT'.",
