    "description": "This RFC aims to comprehensively document the detailed requirements for the StoryWorldEcosystem platform. The documentation will cover features, user roles (author, editor, moderator), collaboration workflows, integration with AI systems (AI for consistency, suggestion of crossover opportunities), API specifications for external collaborations, potential security concerns, accessibility considerations, scalability and performance requirements, technical complexities such as data governance, error handling, and edge cases. Upon completion, a comprehensive technical document detailing the platform architecture, data models, system interfaces, and architectural decisions will be created. Clear use cases for each feature will be provided to aid in understanding their importance and implementation. Additionally, this RFC will delve into considerations related to team collaboration and project management tools within the platform. Upon review and approval, assign to code-architect for further decomposition.",
