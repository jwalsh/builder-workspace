    "description": "Comprehensively document the detailed requirements for the StoryWorldEcosystem platform. This includes features, user roles (author, editor, moderator), collaboration workflows, integration with AI systems (AI for consistency, suggestion of crossover opportunities), API specifications for external collaborations, addressing potential security concerns, considering accessibility in design, outlining the project's scalability and performance requirements, and delving into the technical complexities such as data governance, error handling, and edge cases. Upon completion, create a comprehensive technical document detailing the platform architecture, data models, system interfaces, and any other architectural decisions made during the process. Additionally, provide clear use cases for each feature to aid in the understanding of its importance and implementation.",
