    "description": "This RFC aims to gather and document the comprehensive project requirements for AIAssistantDeveloper, a platform for learning how to develop AI-powered coding assistants. The following areas need special attention: \n1. AI capabilities: Define the AI algorithms and models required for natural language processing, machine learning, and decision-making (consider incorporating reinforcement learning for adaptive behavior).\n2. User Interface (UI): Detail the design principles and wireframes for an intuitive and engaging user experience, focusing on accessibility and responsiveness across various platforms.\n3. API Integration: Identify potential APIs to integrate for seamless third-party service usage, emphasizing on modern tech stacks like GraphQL or RESTful APIs.\n4. Testing Strategy: Outline a comprehensive testing approach (consider Behavior-Driven Development [BDD] and test automation frameworks like Selenium or Cypress). This includes unit tests, integration tests, system tests, and end-to-end tests.\n5. Security Measures: Specify the necessary security measures (implement multi-factor authentication, secure communication channels, and regular vulnerability assessments).\n6. Project Roadmap: Develop a high-level project roadmap that outlines milestones, timelines, and resources required to successfully deliver the platform.\n7. Documentation: Create clear and concise documentation for developers, testers, and users, ensuring usability and accessibility.",
