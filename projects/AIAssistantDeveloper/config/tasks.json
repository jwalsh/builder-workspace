    "title": "Define Project Scope and Requirements - REVISED",
    "description": "This RFC aims to gather and document the comprehensive project requirements for AIAssistantDeveloper, a platform for learning how to develop AI-powered coding assistants. The following areas need special attention:\n1. AI capabilities: Define the AI algorithms and models required for natural language processing, machine learning, and decision-making (consider incorporating reinforcement learning for adaptive behavior). Include clarity on data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation metrics, as well as plans for continuous learning and improvement.\n2. User Interface (UI): Detail the design principles and wireframes for an intuitive and engaging user experience, focusing on accessibility and responsiveness across various platforms. Prioritize progressive enhancement and graceful degradation, while considering conducting usability testing throughout development to ensure user satisfaction and iterate based on feedback.\n3. API Integration: Identify potential APIs to integrate for seamless third-party service usage, emphasizing on modern tech stacks like GraphQL or RESTful APIs. Consider using OpenAPI Specification (OAS) for defining and documenting the APIs, including a plan for versioning and updating.\n4. Testing Strategy: Outline a comprehensive testing approach, considering Behavior-Driven Development [BDD] and test automation frameworks like Selenium or Cypress. This includes unit tests, integration tests, system tests, and end-to-end tests. Consider using Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology and include a plan for continuous integration/continuous deployment, as well as regression testing.\n5. Security Measures: Specify the necessary security measures (implement multi-factor authentication, secure communication channels, and regular vulnerability assessments). Incorporate encryption methods and follow OWASP guidelines, including a risk assessment and threat modeling. Consider hiring a dedicated security specialist for ongoing security monitoring and penetration testing.\n6. Project Roadmap: Develop a high-level project roadmap that outlines milestones, timelines, and resources required to successfully deliver the platform. Consider using Agile methodologies for project management and include a plan for incremental releases and backlog prioritization.\n7. Documentation: Create clear and concise documentation for developers, testers, and users, ensuring usability and accessibility. Use Markdown format for easy editing and collaboration. Include API documentation, user manuals, development guides, test cases, and developer guides focused on AI and machine learning best practices.\n8. Assigned To: code-architect",
