    "description": "This RFC outlines the requirements for the MultiLanguageCodeTranslator. The following programming languages are proposed for support: Python, Java, JavaScript, C++, Ruby, Swift, Go. The tool will handle translations of scripts, functions, modules, classes, and APIs. For a superior user experience (UX), the system architecture is suggested to be modular using microservices. Scalability considerations include implementing caching mechanisms for efficient handling of large numbers of translations. Error handling mechanisms include graceful degradation, logging, and notifications. Performance benchmarks will aim for translation times of under 5 seconds for small code chunks, under 1 minute for medium code chunks, and under 5 minutes for large code chunks. The system will be accessible to users with disabilities by supporting screen readers and keyboard navigation. Dependencies may include existing libraries such as Google's Language Translation API or similar tools. Example use-cases include a Python developer who wants to convert their script into Java, or a web developer who needs to translate JavaScript code into Swift for an iOS app. A high-level Agile approach would involve iterative development cycles with regular feedback from users and team members.",
