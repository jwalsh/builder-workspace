    "description": "Gather and document the project requirements, including the technical specifications for capturing and processing brainwave data (outline the hardware/software requirements for EEG devices, signal processing algorithms, and storage solutions, specify the required sample rate, resolution, and filtering methods), security standards (encryption methods, secure data transfer protocols, access controls, outline key management strategies, and discuss potential vulnerabilities such as replay attacks), user experience expectations (intuitive interface design, minimal latency, error handling, ensure real-time feedback is provided to users for successful/unsuccessful verification), data privacy and compliance requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, etc., define procedures for anonymization, pseudonymization, and consent management), integration with existing systems or third-party services (API documentation, connectivity requirements, discuss potential APIs for authentication, authorization, and notification purposes), and performance benchmarks (define key metrics such as verification accuracy, processing time, and system availability). Collaborate with the project team to ensure all aspects of the system are accounted for. Suggest potential use-cases for the system and its expected impact. Once requirements are defined, consider breaking down this task into smaller subtasks for better management and tracking. The subtasks could include: 1. Hardware/software specifications for EEG devices 2. Signal processing algorithms and storage solutions 3. Security standards and key management strategies 4. User experience design 5. Data privacy and compliance requirements 6. Integration with third-party services 7. Performance benchmarks and use-cases. Upon completion of these subtasks, assign each to appropriate team members based on their expertise. For clarity, suggest breaking down the 'Collaborate with the project team' step into separate tasks for different team members (e.g., technical requirements collaboration, user experience collaboration, security collaboration, etc.). On completion of the revised subtasks, reassign this task to the Project Manager for review and approval. If necessary, update the rfc_state field to 'REVIEW'.",
