    "description": "Gather and document the functional and non-functional requirements for the DatabaseQueryOptimizer tool. The requirements should cover the following aspects: 1) User interface and experience (UX/UI), including accessibility, 2) Database support and connectivity, specifying the list of databases to be supported and the methods of connection (consider popular databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Oracle, SQL Server, and others), 3) Query optimization techniques and algorithms, detailing the specific techniques and algorithms to be implemented (e.g., rule-based, cost-based, or hybrid), 4) Performance metrics and benchmarking, outlining the metrics to track (response time, throughput, CPU usage, etc.) and the methodology for benchmarking, 5) Gamification and learning features, including points system, leaderboards, progress tracking, tutorials, and feedback mechanisms to enhance user engagement and learning experience, 6) Security and data privacy, addressing encryption methods (AES, RSA), user authentication (OAuth, JWT), compliance with industry standards (PCI DSS, GDPR, HIPAA), best practices for secure coding and handling sensitive information, 7) Deployment and scalability, specifying the target platforms (Web, Mobile, Desktop), deployment strategies (SaaS, PaaS, IaaS), and scalability measures to handle increased traffic, considering containerization technologies like Docker or Kubernetes, 8) Integration with other tools or platforms, detailing API specifications (REST, GraphQL) and any necessary integrations, 9) Error handling and exception management, defining the strategy for handling errors and exceptions (providing detailed logging and debugging features), 10) Documentation, ensuring that the project is well-documented for developers, testers, and users (consider using tools like Docusaurus or Sphinx), 11) Performance optimizations, outlining strategies for improving overall performance of the application (consider techniques like code optimization, caching, and asynchronous processing), 12) Localization and internationalization, ensuring that the application can be easily translated to different languages and adapted to different regions.",
