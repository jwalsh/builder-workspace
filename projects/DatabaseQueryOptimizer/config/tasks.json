    "description": "Gather and document the functional and non-functional requirements for the DatabaseQueryOptimizer tool. The requirements should cover the following aspects: 1) User interface and experience (UX/UI), including accessibility, responsive design across various devices, 2) Database support and connectivity, specifying the list of databases to be supported initially (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Oracle, SQL Server) with a roadmap for additional database integrations. Consider popular databases like MariaDB, SQLite, and Cassandra. Define methods of connection, including ODBC/JDBC and native drivers. 3) Query optimization techniques and algorithms, detailing the specific techniques and algorithms to be implemented (e.g., rule-based, cost-based, or hybrid), with a focus on explainable AI for visualizing the optimization process. 4) Performance metrics and benchmarking, outlining the metrics to track (response time, throughput, CPU usage, memory consumption, etc.) and the methodology for benchmarking against industry-standard workloads. 5) Gamification and learning features, including points system, leaderboards, progress tracking, tutorials, and feedback mechanisms to enhance user engagement and learning experience, with a focus on gamifying the query optimization process itself. 6) Security and data privacy, addressing encryption methods (AES, RSA), user authentication (OAuth, JWT), compliance with industry standards (PCI DSS, GDPR, HIPAA), best practices for secure coding and handling sensitive information, including secure data storage and transfer. 7) Deployment and scalability, specifying the target platforms (Web, Mobile, Desktop), deployment strategies (SaaS, PaaS, IaaS), and scalability measures to handle increased traffic. Consider containerization technologies like Docker or Kubernetes, with a focus on microservices architecture. 8) Integration with other tools or platforms, detailing API specifications (REST, GraphQL) and any necessary integrations, including popular data visualization tools. 9) Error handling and exception management, defining the strategy for handling errors and exceptions (providing detailed logging and debugging features), with a focus on providing meaningful error messages to aid in troubleshooting. 10) Documentation, ensuring that the project is well-documented for developers, testers, and users (consider using tools like Docusaurus or Sphinx), with a focus on clear and concise documentation. 11) Performance optimizations, outlining strategies for improving overall performance of the application (consider techniques like code optimization, caching, and asynchronous processing), with a focus on reducing query execution time. 12) Localization and internationalization, ensuring that the application can be easily translated to different languages and adapted to different regions, with support for RTL languages.",
