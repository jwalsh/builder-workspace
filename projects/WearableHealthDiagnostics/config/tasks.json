The document should include specifications for hardware (sensor types, data collection frequencies, power consumption), software (firmware, mobile app, web interface), user interface (design, usability, accessibility), data storage (local, cloud, backup strategies), security (encryption, authentication, authorization), and integrations with external healthcare systems (APIs, standards compliance). The document should also outline the project timeline and milestones.",
