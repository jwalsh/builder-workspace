    "description": "This task involves gathering and documenting the detailed requirements for the VMGuard project. The document should cover specific types of virtual machines (e.g., VMware, Hyper-V, AWS EC2, Azure VMs), cloud environments (public, private, hybrid), backup strategies (full, incremental, differential), backup scheduling options, data retention policies, restore capabilities, security considerations (encryption methods such as AES-256, access controls like RBAC), user interface needs (web-based, mobile app UX/UI design specifics with responsive design for various screen sizes and platforms), integration with existing infrastructure and other tools (API documentation should be included), disaster recovery plans, notification systems, monitoring capabilities, detailed error handling mechanisms. Additionally, consider additional features such as version control, scalability, and compatibility. Break down this task into smaller sub-tasks for efficient progress. The document will serve as the basis for further project development. Once complete, it will be reviewed by the code-architect, project-manager, security-specialist, technical-writer, and qa-tester. It is recommended to include a section on performance metrics and SLAs.",
