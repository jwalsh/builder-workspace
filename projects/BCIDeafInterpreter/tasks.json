    "description": "Revised system architecture design for the BCIDeafInterpreter project. This includes hardware and software components, data flow, integration points, neural signal processing pipeline, communication interfaces, and data storage requirements. Considering scalability, performance, security, and maintainability aspects, outline an approach for dealing with potential issues such as noise in neural signals, real-time processing demands, energy efficiency, and error correction strategies to minimize misinterpretations. Address the need for modularity to facilitate future upgrades and integrations. Discuss power management strategies to ensure efficient use of battery power during mobile operation. Include a discussion on potential implementation challenges and suggested solutions. Lastly, provide an initial outline for system documentation including sections for hardware and software architecture, data flow diagrams, error handling, and power management.",
