This includes identifying key components (BCI hardware, cognitive training modules, user interfaces), technologies (AI, machine learning, BCI protocols), integrations (with existing healthcare platforms or devices if applicable), and constraints (regulatory, technical, resource-related). Provide a detailed system design, data flows, user interactions, scalability considerations, and potential challenges, assumptions, or risks associated with the project. Offer suggestions for potential mitigation strategies, highlighting any areas where further research may be necessary. Include a high-level timeline for project phases, detailing the tasks involved in each phase. Update the rfc_state field to 'REVIEW_IN_PROGRESS' as the document is being revised.",
