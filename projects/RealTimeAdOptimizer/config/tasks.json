    "description": "Updated project requirements documentation for RealTimeAdOptimizer. The document will clearly define the desired features, performance metrics, integration points with existing systems, data sources, security/privacy considerations, potential edge cases, examples of best practices for real-time advertising optimization engines, and provide specific use cases to illustrate these concepts. Additionally, this updated version will specify any required non-functional requirements (such as scalability, reliability, fault tolerance, and real-time processing capabilities), highlighting the expected impact on user engagement and conversion rates. The document will emphasize the need for extensive testing, monitoring, and continuous improvement processes to ensure optimal performance. Furthermore, it will provide a detailed plan for the development, deployment, and maintenance of the system, including milestones, timelines, and resources required. This RFC is ready for review by the Project Manager and Code-Architect. Please note that while the document is ready for review, further input and suggestions from Code-Architect are welcome.",
