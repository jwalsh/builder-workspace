The updated document should clearly define the desired features, performance metrics, integration points with existing systems, data sources, security/privacy considerations, potential edge cases, and provide examples of best practices for real-time advertising optimization engines. In addition, specify any required non-functional requirements (such as scalability, reliability, and fault tolerance) and highlight the expected impact on user engagement and conversion rates.",
