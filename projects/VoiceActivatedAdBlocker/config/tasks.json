    "description": "This RFC outlines the detailed requirements for the VoiceActivatedAdBlocker project. The document will encompass desired features (such as ad filtering, cross-device synchronization, voice command functionality), supported platforms (mobile, desktop, and smart speakers), integration with existing ad-blocking technologies (Adblock Plus, uBlock Origin), user experience considerations (ease of use, minimal impact on performance), data privacy and security requirements (compliance with GDPR, secure storage and transmission of user data), scalability and performance goals (handling high volumes of ads and voice commands), voice command recognition and processing (supporting multiple languages, accurate recognition in noisy environments), AI-powered ad detection and filtering mechanisms (using machine learning to adapt to new ad formats and strategies for bypassing ad-blockers), testing strategies (unit testing, integration testing, user acceptance testing), deployment plans (staging environment, gradual rollout to users), maintenance procedures (regular updates, bug fixes), update strategies (semantic versioning), and any other relevant technical and non-technical aspects. The document will also outline strategies for integrating with existing AI technologies (TensorFlow, OpenCV) and ensuring compliance with advertising industry standards (IAB, Coalition for Better Ads). However, it would be beneficial to break down the project into smaller tasks and assign them to specific team members (task-decomposer). The RFC will also address user onboarding, offboarding, and account management, as well as monetization strategies and business models. It is important to consider the need for multi-language support in the user interface and documentation (technical-writer), as well as accessibility for users with disabilities. Lastly, it will outline the project timeline and milestones, as well as resource allocation and team roles.",
