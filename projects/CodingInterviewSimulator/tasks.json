    "description": "Design the overall system architecture, including the frontend, backend, database, and infrastructure components, ensuring scalability, performance, and security. Consider the following aspects:\n\n1. Frontend: Responsive web application with real-time coding interface and virtual interviewer. Consider using a modern frontend framework like React, Angular, or Vue.js for a smooth user experience.\n2. Backend: RESTful API for handling user authentication, interview scheduling, code execution, and feedback. Use a robust backend framework like Node.js, Django, or Spring Boot.\n3. Database: Store user data, interview questions, solutions, and feedback. Consider using a NoSQL database like MongoDB for flexible schema and a relational database like PostgreSQL for data integrity, depending on the data structure and requirements.\n4. Infrastructure: Containerization using Docker, load balancing with a tool like NGINX or AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB), auto-scaling on a cloud platform like AWS or GCP, and monitoring with tools like Prometheus and Grafana.\n5. Security: Implement industry-standard authentication and authorization mechanisms, data encryption at rest and in transit, secure coding practices like input validation and sanitization, and regular security audits.\n6. Integrations: Support for popular coding platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and version control systems like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.\n7. Real-time Communication: Implement a real-time communication system using WebSockets or a messaging queue like RabbitMQ or Apache Kafka for real-time collaboration between the interviewer and the interviewee.\n8. Scalability and Performance: Design the system to handle a large number of concurrent users and interviews. Consider using caching mechanisms, load balancing, and horizontal scaling techniques.\n9. Monitoring and Logging: Implement robust monitoring and logging systems to track system health, performance, and user activities for debugging and auditing purposes.\n10. Accessibility: Ensure the application is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.",
