    "description": "This RFC aims to gather and document detailed requirements for the CodingInterviewSimulator platform. The following aspects should be considered: \n1. Features: real-time coding environment, interview scenarios [coding challenges, behavioral questions, whiteboard sessions], feedback mechanisms [code review, video/audio recording, real-time hints]\n2. User roles: interviewee, interviewer, admin\n3. Integration with existing systems: GitHub, Google Drive, Zoom\n4. Technical documentation\n5. Accessibility standards\n6. API specifications for third-party integrations\n7. Identification of potential scalability issues and project's security measures.\nAdditionally, consider the following subtasks:\n- Designing the user interface and user experience\n- Developing the backend infrastructure\n- Implementing the real-time feedback system\n- Integrating with third-party APIs (such as GitHub, Google Drive, Zoom)\n- Ensuring compliance with accessibility standards\n- Creating technical documentation for developers and users.",

    "title": "Design System Architecture",
    "description": "Design the overall system architecture, including the frontend, backend, database, and infrastructure components, ensuring scalability, performance, and security. Consider the following aspects:\n\n1. Frontend: Responsive web application with real-time coding interface and virtual interviewer. Use a modern frontend framework like React or Vue.js for a smooth user experience.\n2. Backend: RESTful API for handling user authentication, interview scheduling, code execution, and feedback. Use a robust backend framework like Node.js, Django, or Spring Boot.\n3. Database: Store user data, interview questions, solutions, and feedback. Consider using a combination of NoSQL database like MongoDB for flexible schema and relational database like PostgreSQL for data integrity, depending on the data structure and requirements. Additionally, consider Redis or Memcached for caching to improve performance.\n4. Infrastructure: Containerization using Docker, load balancing with a tool like NGINX or AWS ELB, auto-scaling on a cloud platform like AWS or GCP, and monitoring with tools like Prometheus and Grafana. Also, consider using Kubernetes for managing containerized applications.\n5. Security: Implement industry-standard authentication and authorization mechanisms, data encryption at rest and in transit, secure coding practices like input validation and sanitization, and regular security audits. Implement OWASP recommendations to ensure the application is secure.\n6. Integrations: Support for popular coding platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and version control systems like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.\n7. Real-time Communication: Implement a real-time communication system using WebSockets or a messaging queue like RabbitMQ or Apache Kafka for real-time collaboration between the interviewer and the interviewee.\n8. Scalability and Performance: Design the system to handle a large number of concurrent users and interviews. Consider serverless architectures and Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) for better scalability and performance.\n9. Monitoring and Logging: Implement robust monitoring and logging systems to track system health, performance, and user activities for debugging and auditing purposes. Integrate Splunk or Elasticsearch for log management and analysis.\n10. Accessibility: Ensure the application is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. Follow WCAG guidelines for accessibility.\n11. Documentation: Provide clear and concise documentation for each component of the system, including API references and user guides.",
