    "description": "Update the project scope, objectives, and requirements for the ThreatModelingAutomation system. This should include gathering inputs from key stakeholders (e.g., security experts, software architects, developers) to understand the current threat modeling practices, challenges, and desired features/capabilities of the automated system. Additionally, research existing threat modeling methodologies, tools, and industry best practices to inform the requirements. Consider incorporating a hybrid approach combining machine learning and human expertise for more effective and accurate threat modeling. Also, focus on providing flexible configuration options to cater to diverse threat modeling needs across different domains, while ensuring scalability and maintainability of the system. The hybrid approach should prioritize usability and efficiency, with clear user interfaces for input and output data visualization. Furthermore, document the development process, including milestones, in the RFC to provide a roadmap for the project.",

Incorporate AI and machine learning techniques where appropriate, focusing on data collection, analysis, and threat identification methods. The methodology should also include a clear explanation of how the system will learn from threats over time, improving its threat prediction capabilities. Ensure that the methodology is well-documented for easy understanding and implementation by developers and other team members.
