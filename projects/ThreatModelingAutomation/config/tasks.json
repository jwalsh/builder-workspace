    "description": "Define the project scope, objectives, and requirements for the ThreatModelingAutomation system. This should include gathering inputs from key stakeholders (e.g., security experts, software architects, developers) to understand the current threat modeling practices, challenges, and desired features/capabilities of the automated system. Additionally, research existing threat modeling methodologies, tools, and industry best practices to inform the requirements. Consider incorporating a hybrid approach combining machine learning and human expertise for more effective and accurate threat modeling. Also, focus on providing flexible configuration options to cater to diverse threat modeling needs across different domains.",
