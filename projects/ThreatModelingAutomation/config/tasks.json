    "description": "Update the project scope, objectives, and requirements for the ThreatModelingAutomation system. This should include gathering inputs from key stakeholders (e.g., security experts, software architects, developers) to understand the current threat modeling practices, challenges, and desired features/capabilities of the automated system. Additionally, research existing threat modeling methodologies, tools, and industry best practices to inform the requirements. Consider incorporating a hybrid approach combining machine learning and human expertise for more effective and accurate threat modeling. Also, focus on providing flexible configuration options to cater to diverse threat modeling needs across different domains, while ensuring scalability and maintainability of the system. The hybrid approach should prioritize usability and efficiency, with clear user interfaces for input and output data visualization. Furthermore, document the development process, including milestones, in the RFC to provide a roadmap for the project.",

    "description": "Develop an improved and scalable methodology for automating the threat modeling process. The methodology should encompass a wide range of application architectures and technologies, capable of handling complex systems. Incorporate AI and machine learning techniques where appropriate, focusing on data collection, analysis, and threat identification methods. The methodology should also detail how the system will learn from threats over time, enhancing its predictive capabilities. Ensure that the methodology is well-documented for easy understanding by developers and other team members. Collaborate closely with the security specialist to guarantee comprehensive coverage of all necessary security aspects. To ensure scalability and adaptability, consider using a modular approach that can be easily updated as new technologies emerge. After implementation, conduct thorough testing and documentation for future reference. Finally, upon completion, provide a presentation for team members detailing the methodology, its benefits, and potential future improvements. Update this RFC to 'NEEDS_REVIEW' once the draft is complete, assign it to the project-manager for review.",
