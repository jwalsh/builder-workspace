    "description": "This task involves a comprehensive requirements gathering for the CognitiveWorkloadOptimizer system. The deliverables include user stories, use cases, functional and non-functional requirements, system architecture, data flow diagrams, technology stack recommendations, potential integration points with existing systems, a plan for user testing and feedback collection, as well as documentation for all these components. A focus is given to the role of AI/ML models in managing cognitive load and optimizing productivity. The goal is to create clear, concise, and easy-to-understand documentation. Please note that while the task is currently IN_PROGRESS, it would be beneficial to establish timelines and milestones for completion.",
