The database should support efficient data retrieval, updates, and analytics for near-real-time visibility. Consider data partitioning, indexing, caching strategies (such as Redis or Memcached), and query optimization techniques for optimal performance. Ensure data integrity, security, and compliance with industry standards and regulations applicable to the logistics and maritime industries. Additionally, consider the use of a distributed database system such as Google's Spanner or Amazon's DynamoDB to handle the global scale of the project. To enhance the review process, it would be beneficial to include examples of similar projects that leverage these technologies for scalability and performance. Suggest potential solutions for handling large volumes of data and ensuring low latency in real-time visibility.",
