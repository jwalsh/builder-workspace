    "description": "Gather and document comprehensive requirements for the IoT Smart Home system. This includes specifications for lighting (smart bulbs, dimming, color temperature, compatibility with smart home platforms such as Amazon Alexa, Google Home), temperature control (individual room control, smart thermostats, compatibility with Nest or Honeywell thermostats), security systems (cameras, alarms, door locks, compatibility with Arlo or Ring devices), necessary integrations (voice assistants, mobile apps, integration with Google Home and Amazon Alexa for voice control, mobile app development for iOS and Android platforms), and ensuring compatibility with existing home technologies. Additionally, document any preferences or unique features requested by the end-users, such as scene settings, remote access, and automation rules. The requirements documentation should also address security considerations, user privacy, and data protection strategies.",
