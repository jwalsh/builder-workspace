Communication protocols for robot-to-robot and robot-to-system communication.\n4. Integration with existing construction systems (e.g., project management, inventory management, safety systems).\n5. Fault tolerance, error handling, and failover mechanisms.\n6. Security considerations for data transmission and system access.\n7. Performance optimization and resource allocation strategies.",
