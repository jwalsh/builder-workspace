    "description": "This RFC aims to gather, document, and prioritize the requirements for the CrossTeamSyncBot, including its main features, integrations, target users, functional and non-functional requirements such as scalability, performance, security, maintainability, and user experience. The requirements will be broken down into smaller tasks for easier implementation. Additional focus will be given to identifying potential edge cases and exceptional scenarios that may impact the bot's functionality. The RFC will also include a high-level design and architecture of the bot.",

This document serves as a proposal for discussion and approval. Ensure adherence to project requirements, standards, and best practices in UI/UX design, and take into account feedback from the target user base (diverse teams). Include mockups or wireframes where applicable, and provide detailed annotations on the design decisions made. This RFC is intended to stimulate conversation about the optimal design approach before moving forward with implementation. Address potential challenges and solutions for each aspect of the UI/UX design, such as performance considerations, security concerns, and user feedback mechanisms.",

Deploy to production environment\n7. Added stage: Automated end-to-end functional testing before deployment to production (suggestion for improvement)\n\nThe pipeline should be configured to run automatically on every code commit to the main branch. It should also support manual triggers for testing and deployment to specific environments. Ensure that the pipeline is secure, scalable, and follows best practices for CI/CD. Additionally, consider adding a stage for automated end-to-end functional testing before deployment to production.\n\nThe assigned developer should document the implementation process and provide clear instructions on how to trigger, monitor, and manage the pipeline in the project's documentation. Also, ensure that the documentation includes steps for troubleshooting common issues.\n\nUpdate: Assigning the task to devops-engineer for detailed design and implementation planning.",
