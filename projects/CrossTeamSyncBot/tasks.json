Deploy to production environment\n\nThe pipeline should be configured to run automatically on every code commit to the main branch. It should also support manual triggers for testing and deployment to specific environments. Ensure that the pipeline is secure, scalable, and follows best practices for CI/CD. Additionally, consider adding a stage for automated end-to-end functional testing before deployment to production.\n\nThe assigned developer should document the implementation process and provide clear instructions on how to trigger, monitor, and manage the pipeline in the project's documentation.\n\nUpdate: Assigning the task to code-architect for detailed design and implementation planning.",
