This design should take into account user experience, security, accessibility considerations, and ensure modularity for easy maintenance and future enhancements. The design will be based on a microservices architecture with RESTful APIs, following best practices in software development (e.g., SOLID principles, clean architecture). To improve the clarity of the document, consider adding sections for specific areas such as authentication, data storage, and frontend/backend technology stacks. Additionally, outline the testing strategy for each microservice, and provide a plan for handling potential future enhancements or new feature requests.",

Collaborate with the Security-Specialist and DevOps-Engineer team members for implementation, consult with the Frontend-Developer and Backend-Developer teams for integration into the user interface and API respectively. Document security measures in the technical design specifications for future reference, also include a plan for regular updates to keep up with evolving threats and security standards.
