    "description": "Design the overall system architecture including functional and non-functional requirements, components, data flow diagrams, integration points, scalability considerations, performance optimization strategies. This design should take into account user experience, security, accessibility considerations, and ensure modularity for easy maintenance and future enhancements. The design will be based on a microservices architecture with RESTful APIs, following best practices in software development (e.g., SOLID principles, clean architecture).\n\nTo improve the clarity of the document, sections have been added for specific areas such as authentication, data storage, and frontend/backend technology stacks. The design also outlines the testing strategy for each microservice, provides a plan for handling potential future enhancements or new feature requests.\n\n**Note:** Please review the following sections:\n1. Authentication: [Provide detailed explanation of authentication system] \n2. Data Storage: [Explain data storage solutions and considerations] \n3. Frontend/Backend Technology Stacks: [Detailed breakdown of frontend and backend tech stack choices, including reasons for these choices]\n4. Security Considerations: [Detail security measures taken, including encryption methods, user data protection, and potential vulnerabilities]\n5. Performance Optimization Strategies: [Provide strategies to ensure optimal performance] \n6. Testing Strategy: [Detailed testing strategy for each microservice] \n7. Future Enhancements/New Feature Requests Plan: [Outline a plan for handling future enhancements or new feature requests]\n\nOnce these sections have been reviewed and updated, please provide comments in the 'review_comments' field.\n\n**Status:** NEEDS_WORK",
