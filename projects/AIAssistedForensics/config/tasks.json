    "title": "Define Project Scope and Requirements (Revised)",
    "description": "This RFC outlines the process of gathering and documenting project requirements, scope, and objectives for the AI-assisted digital forensics system. The focus areas include: data sources to be analyzed (e.g., disk images, network traffic logs, email archives, mobile device data, cloud storage data), desired outputs or evidence to be identified (e.g., malware signatures, suspicious file transfers, communication patterns, data exfiltration attempts), performance and scalability requirements (e.g., ability to handle petabytes of data, parallel processing capabilities, distributed computing infrastructure, response times under specific scenarios), legal or regulatory constraints (data privacy laws, chain of custody requirements, admissibility of evidence in court, compliance with relevant forensics standards), expected integration points with existing forensics tools or workflows, user interface and reporting capabilities (user-friendly design, customizable reports, visualizations for easy understanding), potential areas for machine learning model development and improvement (explainable AI, transfer learning, ensemble methods, real-time analysis), considerations for security and ethical implications (data encryption, anonymization, consent management, bias mitigation strategies), a roadmap for the project's development lifecycle, and the involvement of representatives from law enforcement agencies, data analysts, legal teams, cybersecurity experts, and end users throughout this process. It is crucial to involve a technical writer to document the process and ensure clarity and comprehensibility. This updated RFC will guide the design, development, testing, and deployment phases of the project. Upon completion, a comprehensive document detailing these items will be available for review and feedback. This RFC has been reviewed by relevant stakeholders and is now ready for implementation. For task decomposition, it's recommended to create separate tasks for each focus area mentioned above. The defined scope and requirements will serve as the basis for task creation. However, I suggest adding a specific task for 'Performance Benchmarking' under performance and scalability requirements, to ensure that the system can handle real-world scenarios effectively. This updated RFC is now ready for the Project Manager to assign tasks based on the defined scope and requirements.",
