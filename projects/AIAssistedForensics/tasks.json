    "description": "This RFC outlines the process of gathering and documenting project requirements, scope, and objectives for the AI-assisted digital forensics system. The focus areas include: data sources to be analyzed (e.g., disk images, network traffic logs, email archives, mobile device data, cloud storage data), desired outputs or evidence to be identified (e.g., malware signatures, suspicious file transfers, communication patterns, data exfiltration attempts), performance and scalability requirements (e.g., ability to handle petabytes of data, parallel processing capabilities, distributed computing infrastructure), legal or regulatory constraints (data privacy laws, chain of custody requirements, admissibility of evidence in court), expected integration points with existing forensics tools or workflows, user interface and reporting capabilities, and potential areas for machine learning model development and improvement. It is crucial to consider the needs of various stakeholders including law enforcement agencies, data analysts, and legal teams.",
