    "title": "Define Project Scope and Requirements (Revised)",
    "description": "This RFC outlines the process of gathering and documenting project requirements, scope, and objectives for the AI-assisted digital forensics system. The focus areas include: data sources to be analyzed (e.g., disk images, network traffic logs, email archives, mobile device data, cloud storage data), desired outputs or evidence to be identified (e.g., malware signatures, suspicious file transfers, communication patterns, data exfiltration attempts), performance and scalability requirements (e.g., ability to handle petabytes of data, parallel processing capabilities, distributed computing infrastructure, response times under specific scenarios), legal or regulatory constraints (data privacy laws, chain of custody requirements, admissibility of evidence in court, compliance with relevant forensics standards), expected integration points with existing forensics tools or workflows, user interface and reporting capabilities (user-friendly design, customizable reports, visualizations for easy understanding), potential areas for machine learning model development and improvement (explainable AI, transfer learning, ensemble methods, real-time analysis), considerations for security and ethical implications (data encryption, anonymization, consent management, bias mitigation strategies), and a roadmap for the project's development lifecycle. It is crucial to involve representatives from law enforcement agencies, data analysts, legal teams, cybersecurity experts, and end users throughout this process. The defined scope and requirements will guide the design, development, testing, and deployment phases of the project. Upon completion, a comprehensive document detailing these items will be available for review and feedback. This RFC has been reviewed by relevant stakeholders and is now ready to be implemented.",
