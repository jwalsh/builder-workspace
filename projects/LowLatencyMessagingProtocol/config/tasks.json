    "description": "Gather and document the requirements for the low-latency messaging protocol, including performance targets (sub-millisecond latency), security considerations (TLS, authentication using JWT, and authorization), compatibility with existing systems such as WebSocket, gRPC, and potentially WebAssembly. An in-depth analysis of trade-offs between latency, reliability, and security is necessary, especially considering high-frequency trading, online gaming, and other real-time applications. Additionally, explore the potential impact on data integrity, consistency, and error handling.",

The design includes message formats, transport mechanisms, and error handling strategies tailored for high-frequency trading and online gaming environments. Discussion on latency vs reliability trade-offs, scalability, security, and flexibility considerations are provided. Open issues related to potential architectural choices and their implications are identified, along with proposed solutions. Suggestions for further improvements and potential trade-offs are welcomed.",
