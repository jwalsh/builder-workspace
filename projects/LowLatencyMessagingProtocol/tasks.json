    "description": "Gather and document the requirements for the low-latency messaging protocol, including performance targets (sub-millisecond latency), security considerations (TLS, authentication, authorization with JWT), compatibility with existing systems such as WebSocket, gRPC, and potentially WebAssembly. Additionally, consider potential use cases in high-frequency trading, online gaming, and other real-time applications. Detailed analysis of the trade-offs between latency, reliability, and security is necessary.",
