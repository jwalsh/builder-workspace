    "description": "Revised task to thoroughly gather and document the project requirements. The revised requirements include: chatbot's functionality (real-time security advice, phishing detection, policy reminders, incident response guidance), security features (encryption, two-factor authentication, secure user data storage), integration with existing systems (Slack API for internal communication, Active Directory for user authentication), user personas (IT, HR, Finance, and other relevant roles, along with expected behavior patterns), expected usage scenarios (with examples: real-time phishing detection, security policy reminders, incident response guidance), data privacy and compliance considerations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS for finance sector), performance and scalability requirements (response time under 3 seconds, maximum concurrent users: 5000, ability to handle peak usage during security incidents), edge cases for each requirement, usability heuristics such as discoverability, feedback, consistency, minimalism, and error prevention to improve user experience. In addition, this task will include a review of similar solutions in the market for best practices and an exploration of potential AI models suitable for this project (e.g., supervised learning, reinforcement learning). After gathering requirements, a feasibility study should be conducted to ensure the proposed solution aligns with the project goals and budget constraints. Upon completion of these steps, the project will be ready for further task decomposition.",

Outlining data flow, emphasizing on privacy-preserving techniques to ensure user data confidentiality, and detailed explanation of encryption methods to be used.\n3. Integration with existing systems, considering scalability, maintainability, performance requirements, high availability, and compliance with relevant security standards and regulations. The plan includes a diagram illustrating system architecture for better understanding.\n4. Implementing robust security mechanisms throughout the system, including intrusion detection and prevention systems, secure coding practices, and regular vulnerability assessments.\n5. Providing detailed design documentation for each component and their interactions, and a clear roadmap for the development team with timelines and milestones. The documentation will be easily accessible and updated regularly.\n6. Assigning responsibilities for each component to specific team members and ensuring that they have the necessary resources and expertise.\n7. Scheduling regular meetings to discuss progress, address any issues, and make adjustments as needed.",
