The architecture should encompass frontend, backend, and database components, as well as integration points with existing organizational systems. A plan for iterative development, testing, and implementation stages will be outlined, along with documentation requirements. Collaboration with relevant stakeholders (frontend-developer, backend-developer, database-specialist, devops-engineer, security-specialist) is essential to ensure a comprehensive design. Post completion, specific components can be delegated to individual team members for further development.",
