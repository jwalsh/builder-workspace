Key considerations are: input handling (document ingestion, preprocessing), text summarization model (e.g., transformer-based, extractive, abstractive), output generation, user interface, data storage, scalability, security, deployment strategy, accessibility, error handling, and performance optimization. The design will provide a clear definition of each component's role and responsibilities, as well as the expected data flow between them. An initial high-level design will be provided, serving as a foundation for further detailed design and implementation. The document will also detail considerations for accessibility, error handling, and performance optimization.",

To achieve this, consider using distributed databases or cloud storage services like AWS S3 (preferred) or Google Cloud Storage for large-scale deployments, ensuring efficient data retrieval and storage. Implement data partitioning strategies to optimize performance and reduce potential bottlenecks (e.g., sharding by document size or date). For consistency and data integrity, consider using transactional databases like PostgreSQL or eventual consistency models such as the one used in Google's Bigtable or Amazon DynamoDB. Ensure encryption is implemented at rest and during transfer for data security, using industry-standard algorithms (AES-256). Implement automatic data backup strategies to protect against data loss, with multiple daily backups kept for a minimum of 30 days. Lastly, consider implementing versioning for the documents and generated summaries to maintain history and support future revisions.",

The strategy should incorporate automated testing frameworks (e.g., Jest for JavaScript or Pytest for Python), test case management (TestRail/Jira), and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines (e.g., GitLab CI/CD). Additionally, consider the use of tools like Selenium for UI testing, Artillery for performance testing, and Pytest-BDD for behavior-driven development. The strategy should also account for edge cases and exceptional scenarios to ensure the system's functionality, reliability, and robustness. Testing for accessibility and internationalization should be included as well. To optimize testing resources, consider using a combination of unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to cover different layers of the application effectively.\n\n**Updated:** Added consideration for API testing using tools like Postman or REST-assured, depending on the backend technology stack.\n\n**Improvement Suggestions:**\n1. Collaborate with the Technical Writer to develop clear and concise test cases.\n2. Incorporate code coverage analysis tools (e.g., Istanbul for JavaScript or Coverage.py for Python) in the testing strategy.\\n\\n**Assigned To:** code-architect",
