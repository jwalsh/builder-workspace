Each component's role and responsibilities will be clearly described, as well as the expected data flow between them. An initial high-level design will be provided that can serve as a foundation for further detailed design and implementation. Additionally, the document will detail considerations for accessibility, error handling, and performance optimization.",

For consistency and data integrity, consider using transactional databases or eventual consistency models such as the one used in Google's Bigtable or Amazon DynamoDB. Additionally, ensure that encryption is implemented at rest and during transfer for data security. Finally, consider implementing data backup strategies to protect against data loss.",
