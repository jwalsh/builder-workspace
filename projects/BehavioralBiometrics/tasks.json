    "description": "Gather and document the project requirements with a detailed breakdown of the following components: types of user behavior patterns (e.g., keystroke dynamics, mouse movements, touch gestures, eye tracking), authentication mechanisms (multi-factor authentication, continuous authentication, biometrics such as facial recognition or fingerprint scanning), desired level of security (compliance with industry standards such as FIDO U2F and OAuth 2.0), target platforms (web, mobile, desktop, potential integration with IoT devices), performance metrics, scalability considerations, data privacy guidelines, and a roadmap for future enhancements. The documented requirements should be easily accessible to all team members, and the project documentation should be updated accordingly. Upon completion, the RFC will be reviewed by the project manager before proceeding to the next state. Update the project documentation with this information.",
