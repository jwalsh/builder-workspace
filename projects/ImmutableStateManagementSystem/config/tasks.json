The documentation should also cover sections on setup, integration, troubleshooting, testing, security, performance, and collaboration. To ensure the quality of the documentation, it is recommended that the technical writer collaborates closely throughout the process. Additionally, break down the task into smaller, manageable sub-tasks for efficient execution. Once the task is decomposed, assign relevant sub-tasks to appropriate team members (e.g., DevOps for deployment, Frontend/Backend developers for integration, Security Specialist for security considerations, etc.).",
