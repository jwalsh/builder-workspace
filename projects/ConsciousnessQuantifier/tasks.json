The design will encompass the data model, algorithms, user interfaces, and system components. Provide a high-level architecture overview, detailing the interactions between components. Identify potential challenges, risks, and edge cases for each component. Additionally, consider error handling mechanisms, performance optimizations, and security considerations. Upon completion, collaborate with assigned team members to refine and implement the design. Include a section on data privacy and compliance, as this is a critical aspect of the project.",
