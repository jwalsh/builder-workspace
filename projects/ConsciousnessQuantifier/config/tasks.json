    "description": "Design the overall system architecture for the ConsciousnessQuantifier project. The design will focus on maintainability, modularity, scalability, and performance requirements. It will encompass the data model, algorithms, user interfaces, and system components. Provide a high-level architecture overview, detailing the interactions between components, potential challenges, risks, and edge cases for each component, as well as error handling mechanisms, performance optimizations, and security considerations. Consider data privacy and compliance, as this is a critical aspect of the project. Upon completion, collaborate with assigned team members to refine and implement the design. Include sections on data privacy and compliance, as well as an implementation plan. To ensure the system's robustness, it's recommended to adopt a microservices architecture for better modularity, scalability, and fault tolerance. Also, incorporate unit testing in the development process for error handling.",
