    "description": "Design the overall system architecture for the AI-driven logistics optimization system, including components, data flow, integration points, and considerations for scalability, security, performance, maintainability, and usability. The architecture should address the following key areas: 1) Data ingestion and processing pipelines for logistics data, 2) AI/ML models for optimization and decision-making, 3) User interfaces for data visualization and decision support, 4) Integration with existing military logistics systems, 5) Deployment and infrastructure requirements, 6) Monitoring and logging, 7) Disaster recovery and business continuity, 8) Performance and scalability testing strategy, 9) Security measures to protect sensitive data. The design should be modular, flexible, and extensible to accommodate future enhancements and adapt to changing requirements. Also, ensure the system complies with relevant military standards (e.g., DoD 5015.2). Furthermore, consider incorporating containerization technologies such as Docker or Kubernetes for better scalability and ease of deployment. Lastly, include a section on data privacy considerations to address any potential compliance issues.",

    "description": "Design the database schema and data models for storing and managing logistics data, including supply chain information, resource allocation, and related metadata. Ensure the database design is scalable, efficient, and supports the required data operations and queries. Consider using a distributed database system for high availability and fault tolerance, such as Apache Cassandra or PostgreSQL with partitioning for sharding capabilities. Incorporate data security and access control mechanisms to protect sensitive information, including encryption at rest and in transit, role-based access control, and auditing. Develop a data retention and archiving strategy for historical data, considering legal and regulatory requirements, as well as data storage costs. Implement data backup and disaster recovery mechanisms to ensure data integrity and business continuity. Break down the task into smaller subtasks (Task Decomposition). Assign the subtask of 'Database Design Breakdown' to 'task-decomposer'. For the subtask of implementing the database, assign it to a suitable specialist such as 'database-specialist' or 'devops-engineer'. To ensure proper documentation, assign the task of technical writing to 'technical-writer'. Also, consider adding a subtask for 'Data Model Validation and Testing', which can be assigned to 'qa-tester'. Lastly, update the 'rfc_state' field to 'IN_PROGRESS' as the RFC is ready for task decomposition. However, I suggest a minor adjustment in the 'assigned_to' field: Since this RFC involves both architectural decisions and technical implementation, it would be beneficial to assign it to a Project Manager who can oversee the task decomposition, ensure proper documentation, and coordinate the efforts of the specialists involved, but also involve the Code Architect for their expertise on database design.",

The UI should be intuitive, responsive, and accessible, adhering to industry standards and best practices for user experience (UX) design. Ensure that the UI design aligns with the overall system architecture, data models, and facilitates seamless integration with backend components.\n\nThis RFC could be broken down into smaller tasks such as dashboard design, reporting tool design, and data visualization design to improve efficiency and quality in the development process. These breakdowns should be addressed in subsequent RFCs.\n\nDepending on the complexity of the task, it might be necessary to consult with UI/UX experts during the design process for guidance and recommendations. To ensure a visually appealing and easy-to-understand interface, consider incorporating feedback from the intended users (military logistics personnel) throughout the design process.\n\nUpdate the 'assigned_to' field to 'ui-ux-specialist' as this task primarily involves UX/UI design.\n\nUpon completion of the UI design, ensure that all necessary documentation is provided for future reference and maintenance. The documentation should include wireframes, design system guidelines, and interactive prototypes where appropriate.\n\nAdditionally, consider adding a 'due_date' field to set an expected completion date for this task.\n\nHere is a suggested breakdown of the tasks:\n- Wireframe Design\n- Design System Development\n- Interactive Prototype Creation\n- User Testing and Feedback Collection",
