    "description": "Design the database schema and data models for storing and managing logistics data, including supply chain information, resource allocation, and related metadata. Ensure the database design is scalable, efficient, and supports the required data operations and queries. Consider using a distributed database system for high availability and fault tolerance, such as Apache Cassandra or PostgreSQL with partitioning for sharding capabilities. Incorporate data security and access control mechanisms to protect sensitive information, including encryption at rest and in transit, role-based access control, and auditing. Develop a data retention and archiving strategy for historical data, considering legal and regulatory requirements, as well as data storage costs. Implement data backup and disaster recovery mechanisms to ensure data integrity and business continuity. Break down the task into smaller subtasks (Task Decomposition). Assign the subtask of 'Database Design Breakdown' to 'task-decomposer'. For the subtask of implementing the database, assign it to a suitable specialist such as 'database-specialist' or 'devops-engineer'. To ensure proper documentation, assign the task of technical writing to 'technical-writer'. Also, consider adding a subtask for 'Data Model Validation and Testing', which can be assigned to 'qa-tester'. Lastly, update the 'rfc_state' field to 'IN_PROGRESS_DEVELOPMENT' as the RFC has passed the architectural review and is ready for development. The suggestion to assign this RFC to a Project Manager who can oversee the task decomposition, ensure proper documentation, and coordinate the efforts of the specialists involved, but also involve the Code Architect for their expertise on database design is appropriate.",

The UI should be intuitive, responsive, and accessible, adhering to industry standards and best practices for user experience (UX) design. Ensure that the UI design aligns with the overall system architecture, data models, and facilitates seamless integration with backend components.\n\nThis RFC could be broken down into smaller tasks such as dashboard design, reporting tool design, and data visualization design to improve efficiency and quality in the development process. These breakdowns should be addressed in subsequent RFCs.\n\nDepending on the complexity of the task, it might be necessary to consult with UI/UX experts during the design process for guidance and recommendations. To ensure a visually appealing and easy-to-understand interface, consider incorporating feedback from the intended users (military logistics personnel) throughout the design process.\n\nThe current 'assigned_to' field is incorrect. Given that this task primarily involves UX/UI design, it should be reassigned to a UI/UX specialist.\n\nUpon completion of the UI design, ensure that all necessary documentation is provided for future reference and maintenance. The documentation should include wireframes, design system guidelines, and interactive prototypes where appropriate.\n\nAdditionally, consider adding a 'due_date' field to set an expected completion date for this task.\n\nHere is a suggested breakdown of the tasks:\n- Wireframe Design\n- Design System Development\n- Interactive Prototype Creation\n- User Testing and Feedback Collection",
