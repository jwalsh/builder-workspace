    "description": "Design the database schema and data models for storing and managing logistics data, including supply chain information, resource allocation, and related metadata. Ensure the database design is scalable, efficient, and supports the required data operations and queries. Consider using a distributed database system for high availability and fault tolerance, such as a NoSQL database like Apache Cassandra or a relational database with sharding capabilities (e.g., PostgreSQL with partitioning). Incorporate data security and access control mechanisms to protect sensitive information, including encryption at rest and in transit, role-based access control, and auditing. Develop a data retention and archiving strategy for historical data, considering legal and regulatory requirements, as well as data storage costs. Implement data backup and disaster recovery mechanisms to ensure data integrity and business continuity. Upon completion of the database design, consider breaking down the task into smaller subtasks for easier implementation (Task Decomposition).",
