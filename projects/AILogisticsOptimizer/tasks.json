    "description": "Design the database schema and data models for storing and managing logistics data, including supply chain information, resource allocation, and related metadata. Ensure the database design is scalable, efficient, and supports the required data operations and queries. Consider using a distributed database system for high availability and fault tolerance, such as Apache Cassandra or PostgreSQL with partitioning for sharding capabilities. Incorporate data security and access control mechanisms to protect sensitive information, including encryption at rest and in transit, role-based access control, and auditing. Develop a data retention and archiving strategy for historical data, considering legal and regulatory requirements, as well as data storage costs. Implement data backup and disaster recovery mechanisms to ensure data integrity and business continuity. Upon completion of the database design, break down the task into smaller subtasks for easier implementation (Task Decomposition). Assign the subtask of 'Database Design Breakdown' to 'task-decomposer'. For the subtask of implementing the database, assign it to a suitable specialist such as 'database-specialist' or 'devops-engineer'. To ensure proper documentation, assign the task of technical writing to 'technical-writer'. Also, consider adding a subtask for 'Data Model Validation and Testing', which can be assigned to 'qa-tester'. Lastly, update the 'rfc_state' field to 'IN_PROGRESS' as the RFC is ready for task decomposition.",

The UI should be intuitive, responsive, and accessible, adhering to industry standards and best practices for user experience (UX) design.

These breakdowns should be addressed in subsequent RFCs.\n\nDepending on the complexity of the task, it might be necessary to consult with UI/UX experts during the design process for guidance and recommendations. To ensure a visually appealing and easy-to-understand interface, consider incorporating feedback from the intended users (military logistics personnel) throughout the design process.\n\nUpdate the 'assigned_to' field to 'frontend-developer' as this task primarily involves frontend development.\n\nUpon completion of the UI design, ensure that all necessary documentation is provided for future reference and maintenance.",
