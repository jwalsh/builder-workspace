This diagram illustrates the flow of data and processing in our Documentation Analytics Engine, utilizing various AWS services including Amazon Bedrock for advanced analysis and Amazon OpenSearch for efficient querying.

** Infrastructure as Code

We use Terraform to manage our infrastructure. The configuration is split into dev and prod environments, located in the `infrastructure/` directory.

*** Development Environment (us-west-2)

To set up the development environment:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
cd infrastructure/dev
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
#+END_SRC

*** Production Environment (us-east-2)

To set up the production environment:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
cd infrastructure/prod
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
#+END_SRC

** Data Import

The trial exhibits were initially imported using the following command:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
mv us-and-plaintiff-states-v-google-llc-2023-trial-exhibits/* data/us-v-google-2023
#+END_SRC

** Mirroring Justice.gov

To create an up-to-date mirror of the trial exhibits from the Justice.gov website, use the =mirror_justice_gov.sh= script in the =scripts= directory. This script will create a dated archive of the exhibits.

To run the script:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
./scripts/mirror_justice_gov.sh
#+END_SRC

The mirrored data will be saved in the =data/mirrors/[DATE_TIME]/= directory, organized by date and time. Each mirror will contain the specific path =us-and-plaintiff-states-v-google-llc-2023-trial-exhibits/= with the relevant PDF files.

** Usage

1. Set up the project structure by running =./scripts/build_project.sh=
2. Import or mirror the required data as described above
3. Deploy the infrastructure using Terraform for the desired environment
4. Implement the analytics engine in the =src/analytics= directory
5. Deploy Lambda functions and API Gateway endpoints
6. Run tests using =./tests/test_and_validate.py=
7. Monitor the system using AWS CloudWatch and the custom =deploy_and_monitor.sh= script
