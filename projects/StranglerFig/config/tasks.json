    "description": "Develop a strategy for running the legacy monolithic system and the new microservices in parallel, allowing for comparison and validation of responses. The strategy should include the following components:\n\n1. A request routing mechanism to distribute incoming requests to both the legacy system and the new microservices.\n2. A response comparison mechanism to validate that the responses from the legacy system and the new microservices are identical within an acceptable error threshold (to account for minor API differences).\n3. A logging and monitoring system to track any discrepancies or errors during the parallel run, including performance metrics.\n4. A rollback plan in case of critical issues or failures during the parallel run, with clear steps and responsibilities.\n5. A performance monitoring and optimization plan to ensure the parallel run does not adversely impact system performance, with regular benchmarking and load testing.\n6. Consider integration of the strategy with existing CI/CD pipelines for seamless deployment.\n7. Ensure compliance with security best practices throughout the implementation process.\n8. Incorporate user-friendly error handling mechanisms to improve user experience during the parallel run.\n9. Provide documentation on the parallel run strategy, including setup instructions and troubleshooting guidelines.\n10. Conduct regular reviews of the system performance, errors, and user feedback during the parallel run.",
