    "description": "Gather and document the project requirements, including the types of technical debt to be analyzed (e.g., code smells, architectural issues, security vulnerabilities, performance bottlenecks), the programming languages and frameworks to be supported (Java, Python, React, Angular, Node.js with a focus on popular and commonly used ones in our organization), the desired output formats (reports, dashboards, code annotations, integration with issue trackers like Jira or GitHub Issues), the integration points with existing development tools and processes (CI/CD pipelines, code review tools such as GitHub Code Review and GitLab Merge Requests), and the target environments (cloud, on-premises with a preference for AWS and Azure). Additionally, consider including support for monitoring open-source libraries used in projects to identify any known vulnerabilities or outdated versions. The project should also provide recommendations for remediation strategies for each identified technical debt item.",
