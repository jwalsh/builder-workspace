    "title": "Define Project Scope and Requirements (Revised)",
    "description": "The project requirements have been revised to include the following: \n1. Analysis of technical debt types: code smells, architectural issues, security vulnerabilities, performance bottlenecks, and design issues.\n2. Support for popular programming languages and frameworks in our organization: Java, Python, React, Angular, Node.js with a focus on common ones like Java 8/11, Python 3.x, React 16+, Angular 7+, and Node.js LTS versions.\n3. Output formats will include reports, dashboards, code annotations, and integration with issue trackers such as Jira or GitHub Issues.\n4. Integration points with existing development tools and processes: CI/CD pipelines, code review tools like GitHub Code Review and GitLab Merge Requests.\n5. Target environments: cloud (AWS and Azure) and on-premises solutions.\n6. Monitoring of open-source libraries used in projects to identify known vulnerabilities or outdated versions.\n7. Provision of remediation strategies for each identified technical debt item.\n8. For the 'Define Project Scope and Requirements' task, I recommend assigning it to a project manager who can oversee this process, ensure proper documentation, and coordinate with all teams involved.\n9. The RFC is now ready for the 'Implementation' state.",
