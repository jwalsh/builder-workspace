The revised design should include: a) overall architecture of the system b) components c) data flow d) integration points e) key considerations for maintainability, scalability, and performance f) implementation of machine learning algorithms where appropriate g) API gateways for service discovery and load balancing h) serverless architectures where feasible i) data privacy and security strategies j) documentation best practices k) future integration with other systems within the organization l) compatibility with industry standards m) a roadmap for the implementation of this design n) testing and documentation for smooth operation and ease of maintenance. Emphasize that the design should adhere to a microservices architecture approach, with a clear separation of frontend and backend. Additionally, provide a more detailed breakdown of tasks within the roadmap, making it easier to understand dependencies between them. Assign this task to the 'code-architect' for further development.",
