    "description": "Revise the detailed requirements for the PhishingSimulator platform. This includes features, functionality, integrations, security considerations, compliance requirements, data privacy regulations, target audience, user roles, access controls, desired user experience and user interface requirements, potential integrations with existing systems or third-party services, required infrastructure, hosting, and deployment considerations, data storage, backup, and retention policies, reporting and analytics requirements, performance, scalability, and availability targets, project timeline, milestones, and resource requirements. For the scope of this RFC, please focus on the functional and technical requirements, leaving the non-functional requirements (like usability, accessibility, etc.) for subsequent RFCs. This RFC is ready for the next state - 'Implementation'.",
