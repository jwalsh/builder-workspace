Implement secure coding practices, such as input validation, output encoding, and protection against common web vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, CSRF, SQL injection). Establish a security incident response plan, regular security testing and monitoring processes. Implement secure DevOps practices, including secure code repositories, secure build and deployment processes, and secure infrastructure management. Specific tasks include: implement multi-factor authentication, follow OWASP principles, perform regular vulnerability assessments, establish a bug bounty program, ensure encryption of user data at rest and in transit, and enforce least privilege access.

The test suite design should accommodate for future expansions and updates to the AI Urban Planner system. To ensure comprehensive coverage, consider using code coverage tools like Istanbul or Coverage.py. Additionally, document the testing strategies and methodologies in the test suite for better understanding and maintenance. Due to the complexity of the project, break down this task into smaller subtasks as needed. Consider integrating existing testing tools such as Jest or Pytest for smooth implementation and ease of use by the development team.
