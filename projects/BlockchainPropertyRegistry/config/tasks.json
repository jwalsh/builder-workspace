    "title": "Define Project Scope and Requirements - REVISED",
    "description": "Thoroughly document the comprehensive requirements for the blockchain-based property registry system, covering functional and non-functional aspects, stakeholder needs, regulatory compliance (e.g., real estate laws, data privacy, KYC/AML), security and privacy considerations (e.g., data encryption, access controls), integration with existing systems (if any), and any other relevant constraints or assumptions. Focus on clarity, completeness, and alignment with project goals and objectives. Prioritize scalability, performance, fault tolerance, and future enhancements/integrations. Include edge cases, error handling mechanisms, and consider potential bottlenecks and optimization opportunities.\n\nConsider the following additional details:\n- User Interface Design: Wireframes, mockups, or prototypes for user interactions and interfaces.\n- Data Modeling: Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs) or similar visualizations to represent the structure of data within the system. Include normalization strategies and database design patterns. Make sure to address relationships between entities, multi-tenancy, and any other complex data structures.\n- API Specification: Definitions for API endpoints, request/response formats, error handling, authentication, and authorization. Include documentation on API versioning, backwards compatibility, testing strategies, and security considerations such as OAuth 2.0 or JWT. Also, specify the methods used for data validation.\n- System Performance Monitoring: Metrics, logging, and alerting strategies to ensure the system performs optimally under varying loads. Consider adding details on monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana), thresholds, and escalation procedures for critical alerts. Include benchmarking strategies and performance benchmarks.\n- Documentation: Add a section on documentation, including how to write and maintain technical documentation, the structure of the documentation, and who is responsible for it.\n\nUpdate the requirements document as necessary based on feedback from stakeholders, domain experts, and developers. Once complete, review with the project manager for approval.\n\nNote: It is recommended to include a section for performance benchmarks and benchmarking strategies to evaluate the system's scalability and performance.\n\nUpdate the rfc_state field if the RFC is ready for the next state.",
