    "description": "Thoroughly document the comprehensive requirements for the blockchain-based property registry system, covering functional and non-functional aspects, stakeholder needs, regulatory compliance (e.g., real estate laws, data privacy, KYC/AML), security and privacy considerations (e.g., data encryption, access controls), integration with existing systems (if any), and any other relevant constraints or assumptions. Focus on clarity, completeness, and alignment with project goals and objectives. Prioritize scalability, performance, fault tolerance, and future enhancements/integrations. Include edge cases, error handling mechanisms, and consider potential bottlenecks and optimization opportunities.\n\nConsider the following additional details:\n- User Interface Design: Wireframes, mockups, or prototypes for user interactions and interfaces.\n- Data Modeling: Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs) or similar visualizations to represent the structure of data within the system.\n- API Specification: Definitions for API endpoints, request/response formats, error handling, authentication, and authorization.\n- System Performance Monitoring: Metrics, logging, and alerting strategies to ensure the system performs optimally under varying loads.\n\nUpdate the requirements document as necessary based on feedback from stakeholders, domain experts, and developers. Once complete, review with the project manager for approval.",
