    "title": "Define Project Scope and Requirements (Revised)",
    "description": "This RFC proposes a clear definition of the project scope, objectives, and high-level requirements for the RequirementsAI assistant. The project aims to develop an AI model capable of interpreting and structuring software requirements from stakeholder inputs using advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques, machine learning, user interface design, and integration with existing development workflows. The assistant should be able to convert unstructured stakeholder inputs into structured requirements, allowing for efficient and effective management of project requirements. It is crucial to consider accessibility standards, scalability, security aspects, maintainability, and performance in the development process. The RFC will also outline the testing and documentation processes, focusing on thorough unit testing, integration testing, system testing, functional testing, performance testing, and stress testing. Additionally, it will emphasize the importance of clear and concise technical documentation for the project, including design documents, API specifications, user guides, and release notes. Lastly, the RFC encourages collaboration with other teams to ensure a cohesive development process, and encourages regular code reviews and pair programming sessions. If approved, this RFC will be ready for implementation and assigned to the code-architect for further task decomposition.",
