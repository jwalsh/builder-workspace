    "description": "Gather and document the project requirements in detail. This includes the types of code repositories to be analyzed (e.g., public, private, open-source, hybrid), programming languages and frameworks to be supported (Python, Java, JavaScript, Ruby, C++, etc.), desired bug prediction accuracy (80% or higher with a focus on precision), required machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Neural Networks, SVM, Decision Trees, Ensemble Methods for improved performance), data collection methods (APIs, web scraping, code repositories integration), methods for handling large-scale repositories (partitioning, sampling, clustering), real-time processing capabilities, scalability strategies (cloud services, microservices architecture), security considerations such as data privacy and protection (encryption, anonymization, access controls), and any other relevant constraints or requirements. Also, document the expected performance metrics (e.g., precision, recall, F1 score, Area Under the ROC Curve) and the methodology for evaluating these metrics using cross-validation and a holdout test set, and consider incorporating techniques like stacking or boosting to improve model performance. Provide guidelines for model explainability to ensure understandable results.",
