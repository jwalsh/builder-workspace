## Abstract
This RFC proposes implementing a fully managed Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) solution using Knowledge Bases for Amazon Bedrock in the CodeLibra project. This implementation aims to enhance the capabilities of CodeLibra by leveraging large language models (LLMs) with domain-specific knowledge, improving code analysis, and providing more accurate and contextually relevant responses to user queries.

## Background and Motivation
CodeLibra currently provides code analysis and management capabilities. By implementing a RAG solution using Knowledge Bases for Amazon Bedrock, we can significantly enhance these capabilities by:
1. Improving the accuracy and relevance of code analysis results
2. Providing more context-aware responses to user queries
3. Leveraging up-to-date information from various data sources
4. Enhancing the overall user experience with more intelligent interactions

## Proposal
We propose implementing a RAG solution using Knowledge Bases for Amazon Bedrock with the following components:

1. Data Sources Setup
   - Amazon S3 for document storage
   - Web crawler for relevant online resources

2. Vector Store
   - Amazon OpenSearch Serverless for vector storage

3. Knowledge Base Configuration
   - Setup and management of Knowledge Bases in Amazon Bedrock

4. Integration with CodeLibra
   - API development for RAG queries
   - User interface updates to support RAG-enhanced features

5. Foundational Model Selection
   - Default: Anthropic Claude Instant
   - Amazon Titan Embeddings G1 - Text for knowledge base embedding

6. Monitoring and Maintenance
   - Regular synchronization of data sources
   - Performance monitoring and optimization

## Detailed Design

### 1. Architecture Overview
```
[User Interface] <-> [API Gateway] <-> [Lambda Functions] <-> [Amazon Bedrock]
                                                          <-> [Knowledge Bases]
                                                          <-> [OpenSearch Serverless]
                                                          <-> [S3 Bucket]
                                                          <-> [Web Crawler]
```

### 2. Data Sources Setup
```yaml
# CloudFormation snippet for S3 bucket
Resources:
  CodeLibraDataBucket:
    Type: 'AWS::S3::Bucket'
    Properties:
      BucketName: 'codelibra-knowledge-base-data'
      VersioningConfiguration:
        Status: Enabled
      BucketEncryption:
        ServerSideEncryptionConfiguration:
          - ServerSideEncryptionByDefault:
              SSEAlgorithm: AES256
```

### 3. Knowledge Base Configuration
```python
# Python snippet for Knowledge Base setup
import boto3

bedrock = boto3.client('bedrock-knowledge-base')

response = bedrock.create_knowledge_base(
    name='CodeLibraKnowledgeBase',
    description='Knowledge base for CodeLibra project',
    roleArn='arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/CodeLibraKnowledgeBaseRole',
    knowledgeBaseConfiguration={
        'type': 'VECTOR',
        'vectorConfiguration': {
            'embeddingModel': {
                'modelId': 'amazon.titan-embed-text-v1'
            }
        }
    }
)
```

### 4. Integration with CodeLibra
```python
# Python snippet for RAG query
def rag_query(query, knowledge_base_id):
    response = bedrock.retrieve(
        knowledgeBaseId=knowledge_base_id,
        retrievalQuery={
            'text': query
        },
        retrievalConfiguration={
            'vectorSearchConfiguration': {
                'numberOfResults': 3
            }
        }
    )
    
    # Process and return results
    return process_results(response)
```

### 5. User Interface Update
```javascript
// React component for RAG-enhanced code analysis
function RAGCodeAnalysis({ code }) {
  const [analysis, setAnalysis] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    async function analyzeCode() {
      const result = await api.post('/analyze', { code, useRAG: true });
      setAnalysis(result.data);
    }
    analyzeCode();
  }, [code]);

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Code Analysis (RAG-enhanced)</h2>
      <pre>{analysis}</pre>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Pros and Cons

### Pros
- Enhances code analysis with context-aware information
- Improves accuracy and relevance of responses to user queries
- Leverages up-to-date information from multiple sources
- Fully managed solution reduces operational overhead
- Scalable and flexible architecture

### Cons
- Introduces additional AWS service dependencies
- May increase overall system complexity
- Potential for increased costs due to usage of managed services
- Requires ongoing maintenance of knowledge base and data sources

## Alternatives Considered
1. Custom RAG implementation: More flexible but requires significant development and maintenance effort
2. Third-party AI-powered code analysis tools: May offer similar capabilities but could lead to vendor lock-in
3. Enhancing existing code analysis without RAG: Simpler but limits the potential for improvement

## Implementation Plan
1. Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2): Set up S3 bucket and web crawler for data sources
2. Phase 2 (Weeks 3-4): Configure Knowledge Bases and OpenSearch Serverless
3. Phase 3 (Weeks 5-6): Develop API integration for RAG queries
4. Phase 4 (Weeks 7-8): Update user interface to support RAG-enhanced features
5. Phase 5 (Weeks 9-10): Testing, optimization, and documentation
6. Phase 6 (Week 11): Employee training and soft launch
7. Phase 7 (Week 12): Full production deployment

## Open Questions
1. What specific web sources should we include in our web crawler configuration?
2. How often should we synchronize our knowledge base with the data sources?
3. What metrics should we track to measure the effectiveness of the RAG implementation?
4. How will we handle potential biases or inaccuracies in the LLM responses?

## Conclusion
Implementing a fully managed RAG solution using Knowledge Bases for Amazon Bedrock will significantly enhance CodeLibra's capabilities. It will provide more accurate and context-aware code analysis, improve user interactions, and leverage up-to-date information from various sources. While it introduces some complexity and potential costs, the benefits in terms of improved functionality and user experience make it a valuable addition to the CodeLibra project.
