## Abstract
This RFC proposes a comprehensive monitoring and observability strategy for the CodeLibra project. It outlines the implementation of a robust system to track application performance, user behavior, and system health, as well as the integration of DORA metrics for measuring DevOps performance.

## Background and Motivation
As CodeLibra grows in complexity and usage, it becomes crucial to have a clear and comprehensive view of its performance, user interactions, and overall health. Additionally, tracking DORA metrics will provide valuable insights into our development and deployment processes. This RFC aims to address these needs by proposing a unified monitoring and observability strategy.

## Proposal
We propose implementing a multi-layered monitoring and observability solution using AWS services, open-source tools, and custom integrations. The solution will cover the following areas:

1. Infrastructure Monitoring
2. Application Performance Monitoring (APM)
3. Log Management
4. User Behavior Analytics
5. DORA Metrics Tracking
6. Alerting and Incident Response
7. Dashboards and Visualization

### 1. Infrastructure Monitoring
- Use AWS CloudWatch for monitoring AWS resources (EC2, Lambda, API Gateway, etc.)
- Implement custom CloudWatch metrics for specific infrastructure components
- Set up CloudWatch alarms for critical infrastructure metrics

### 2. Application Performance Monitoring (APM)
- Integrate AWS X-Ray for distributed tracing
- Implement custom instrumentation for critical code paths
- Use CloudWatch Application Insights for .NET and SQL Server workloads

### 3. Log Management
- Centralize logs using CloudWatch Logs
- Implement structured logging in all application components
- Use CloudWatch Logs Insights for log analysis and querying

### 4. User Behavior Analytics
- Implement client-side tracking using AWS Kinesis Data Streams
- Process and analyze user events with AWS Kinesis Data Analytics
- Store processed data in Amazon S3 for long-term analysis

### 5. DORA Metrics Tracking
- Implement custom metrics for:
  - Deployment Frequency
  - Lead Time for Changes
  - Time to Restore Service
  - Change Failure Rate
- Store DORA metrics in CloudWatch Custom Metrics
- Create automated processes to calculate and update these metrics

### 6. Alerting and Incident Response
- Set up CloudWatch Alarms for critical metrics and logs
- Integrate with AWS SNS for notification delivery
- Implement an escalation policy using AWS SNS and AWS Lambda

### 7. Dashboards and Visualization
- Create CloudWatch Dashboards for different stakeholders (Dev, Ops, Management)
- Implement custom dashboards using AWS QuickSight for advanced visualizations
- Create a central "single pane of glass" view combining all critical metrics

## Detailed Design

### Infrastructure Monitoring
```hcl
resource "aws_cloudwatch_metric_alarm" "high_cpu_alarm" {
  alarm_name          = "high-cpu-utilization"
  comparison_operator = "GreaterThanThreshold"
  evaluation_periods  = "2"
  metric_name         = "CPUUtilization"
  namespace           = "AWS/EC2"
  period              = "120"
  statistic           = "Average"
  threshold           = "80"
  alarm_description   = "This metric monitors ec2 cpu utilization"
  alarm_actions       = [aws_sns_topic.alerts.arn]
}
```

### Application Performance Monitoring
```python
from aws_xray_sdk.core import xray_recorder

@xray_recorder.capture('process_request')
def process_request(request):
    # Process the request
    result = do_something_with(request)
    return result
```

### Log Management
```python
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)

def some_function():
    logger.info("Processing started", extra={"user_id": user.id, "action": "process_start"})
    # Function logic here
    logger.info("Processing completed", extra={"user_id": user.id, "action": "process_complete"})
```

### User Behavior Analytics
```python
import boto3

kinesis_client = boto3.client('kinesis')

def track_user_event(event_data):
    kinesis_client.put_record(
        StreamName='user-events',
        Data=json.dumps(event_data),
        PartitionKey=str(event_data['user_id'])
    )
```

### DORA Metrics Tracking
```python
import boto3

cloudwatch = boto3.client('cloudwatch')

def log_dora_metric(metric_name, value):
    cloudwatch.put_metric_data(
        Namespace='DORA',
        MetricData=[
            {
                'MetricName': metric_name,
                'Value': value,
                'Unit': 'Count'
            },
        ]
    )
```

## Pros and Cons

### Pros
- Comprehensive visibility into system performance and health
- Early detection of issues through proactive monitoring
- Improved ability to troubleshoot and resolve incidents
- Data-driven decision making for development and operations
- Enhanced understanding of user behavior and application usage

### Cons
- Increased complexity in the overall system
- Potential for increased costs due to additional AWS service usage
- Requires team training for effective use of new tools and dashboards
- May require updates to application code for proper instrumentation

## Alternatives Considered
1. ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana): Offers powerful log management and visualization but requires more management overhead.
2. Prometheus and Grafana: Provides robust monitoring and alerting but may require more setup and maintenance in an AWS environment.
3. Datadog: Offers a comprehensive observability platform but introduces vendor lock-in and higher costs.

## Implementation Plan
1. Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2): Set up basic CloudWatch monitoring and alarms
2. Phase 2 (Weeks 3-4): Implement centralized logging and APM with X-Ray
3. Phase 3 (Weeks 5-6): Develop user behavior tracking and DORA metrics collection
4. Phase 4 (Weeks 7-8): Create comprehensive dashboards and fine-tune alerting
5. Phase 5 (Weeks 9-10): Team training and documentation

## Open Questions
1. How will we handle data retention for logs and metrics?
2. What is the estimated cost increase for implementing this observability strategy?
3. How will we ensure data privacy and compliance with regulations like GDPR?

## Conclusion
Implementing this comprehensive monitoring and observability strategy will significantly enhance our ability to understand, maintain, and improve the CodeLibra system. While it introduces some complexity and potential costs, the benefits in terms of system reliability, performance insights, and operational efficiency make it a worthwhile investment.
