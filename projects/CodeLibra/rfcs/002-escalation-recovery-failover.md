## Abstract
This RFC proposes a comprehensive strategy for handling incidents, managing downtime, implementing recovery procedures, and establishing failover mechanisms to US West 2 for the CodeLibra project. The goal is to minimize service disruptions, ensure rapid response to incidents, and maintain high availability across multiple AWS regions.

## Background and Motivation
As CodeLibra grows in importance and user base, it's crucial to have robust processes in place for handling incidents and ensuring continuous service availability. This RFC aims to establish clear procedures for escalation, minimize downtime impact, define recovery processes, and implement cross-region failover to enhance the overall resilience of the CodeLibra system.

## Proposal
We propose implementing a multi-faceted approach to incident management and high availability:

1. Incident Escalation Process
2. Downtime Management
3. Recovery Procedures
4. Failover to US West 2
5. Testing and Simulation
6. Documentation and Training

### 1. Incident Escalation Process
- Implement a tiered on-call system using PagerDuty or similar service
- Define severity levels for different types of incidents
- Establish clear escalation paths based on incident severity and duration
- Integrate alerting with AWS CloudWatch and custom monitoring systems

### 2. Downtime Management
- Implement a status page using a service like StatusPage.io
- Establish communication templates for different types of incidents
- Define procedures for planned maintenance windows
- Implement automated failover for critical services where possible

### 3. Recovery Procedures
- Develop detailed runbooks for common failure scenarios
- Implement automated recovery scripts where possible
- Establish regular backup and restore testing processes
- Define Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) for critical services

### 4. Failover to US West 2
- Implement active-active or active-passive multi-region setup
- Use AWS Route 53 for DNS-based failover
- Replicate critical data across regions using services like DynamoDB Global Tables
- Implement cross-region read replicas for relational databases

### 5. Testing and Simulation
- Conduct regular disaster recovery (DR) drills
- Implement chaos engineering practices using tools like AWS Fault Injection Simulator
- Perform regular failover testing to ensure smooth transition between regions

### 6. Documentation and Training
- Maintain up-to-date incident response playbooks
- Conduct regular training sessions for on-call staff
- Implement post-incident review process and maintain a knowledge base of past incidents

## Detailed Design

### Incident Escalation Process
```yaml
# PagerDuty Escalation Policy Example
escalation_policies:
  - name: "CodeLibra Critical Incidents"
    escalation_rules:
      - targets:
          - type: "user_reference"
            id: "PRIMARY_ON_CALL_USER_ID"
        escalation_delay_in_minutes: 15
      - targets:
          - type: "user_reference"
            id: "SECONDARY_ON_CALL_USER_ID"
        escalation_delay_in_minutes: 15
      - targets:
          - type: "user_reference"
            id: "MANAGER_USER_ID"
        escalation_delay_in_minutes: 30
```

### Downtime Management
```python
# Status Page Update Script
import statuspage

# Initialize the StatusPage client
client = statuspage.Client(api_key='your-api-key')

# Update component status
def update_component_status(component_id, status):
    client.components.update(
        page_id='your-page-id',
        component_id=component_id,
        data={'status': status}
    )

# Example usage
update_component_status('api-component-id', 'major_outage')
```

### Recovery Procedures
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Example Recovery Script for Database Restore

# Set variables
DB_INSTANCE="codeLibra-db"
SNAPSHOT_ID="codeLibra-snapshot-20230922"

# Restore the DB instance from the snapshot
aws rds restore-db-instance-from-db-snapshot \
    --db-instance-identifier $DB_INSTANCE \
    --db-snapshot-identifier $SNAPSHOT_ID

# Wait for the DB instance to become available
aws rds wait db-instance-available --db-instance-identifier $DB_INSTANCE

echo "Database restored successfully"
```

### Failover to US West 2
```hcl
# Terraform configuration for Route 53 failover

resource "aws_route53_health_check" "primary" {
  fqdn              = "primary.codeLibra.com"
  port              = 443
  type              = "HTTPS"
  resource_path     = "/health"
  failure_threshold = "3"
  request_interval  = "30"
}

resource "aws_route53_record" "www" {
  zone_id = aws_route53_zone.main.zone_id
  name    = "www.codeLibra.com"
  type    = "A"

  failover_routing_policy {
    type = "PRIMARY"
  }

  set_identifier = "primary"
  health_check_id = aws_route53_health_check.primary.id

  alias {
    name                   = aws_lb.primary.dns_name
    zone_id                = aws_lb.primary.zone_id
    evaluate_target_health = true
  }
}

resource "aws_route53_record" "www_secondary" {
  zone_id = aws_route53_zone.main.zone_id
  name    = "www.codeLibra.com"
  type    = "A"

  failover_routing_policy {
    type = "SECONDARY"
  }

  set_identifier = "secondary"

  alias {
    name                   = aws_lb.secondary.dns_name
    zone_id                = aws_lb.secondary.zone_id
    evaluate_target_health = true
  }
}
```

## Pros and Cons

### Pros
- Minimizes service disruptions and downtime
- Improves incident response times and effectiveness
- Enhances system resilience through multi-region failover
- Provides clear processes for handling various incident scenarios
- Improves team preparedness through regular testing and training

### Cons
- Increases operational complexity
- Requires significant time investment in setup and ongoing maintenance
- May increase costs due to multi-region infrastructure
- Requires regular review and updates to keep processes current

## Alternatives Considered
1. Single Region High Availability: Less complex but doesn't provide protection against region-wide AWS outages.
2. Manual Failover Process: Lower upfront implementation cost but slower response times during incidents.
3. Third-party Disaster Recovery as a Service (DRaaS): Could provide managed DR but may introduce vendor lock-in and integration challenges.

## Implementation Plan
1. Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2): Set up incident escalation process and PagerDuty integration
2. Phase 2 (Weeks 3-4): Implement status page and downtime communication procedures
3. Phase 3 (Weeks 5-6): Develop and test recovery procedures and scripts
4. Phase 4 (Weeks 7-10): Implement multi-region failover architecture
5. Phase 5 (Weeks 11-12): Conduct comprehensive testing and team training
6. Phase 6 (Ongoing): Regular drills, updates to documentation, and process refinement

## Open Questions
1. What is the acceptable RPO and RTO for different components of the CodeLibra system?
2. How will we handle data consistency issues during and after a failover event?
3. What are the cost implications of maintaining an active-active multi-region setup?
4. How will we ensure that all team members, including new hires, are adequately trained on these procedures?

## Conclusion
Implementing this comprehensive strategy for incident response, downtime management, recovery, and failover will significantly enhance the resilience and availability of the CodeLibra system. While it requires substantial effort and introduces some complexity, the benefits in terms of system reliability and reduced downtime make it a critical investment for the long-term success of the project.
