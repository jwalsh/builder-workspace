# CodeLibra Documentation Structure

Here's a suggested structure for your `docs/` directory, with Org mode files that use tangle and Babel:

```
docs/
├── README.org
├── architecture.org
├── development-guide.org
├── aws-setup.org
├── metrics-and-monitoring.org
├── ci-cd-pipeline.org
└── user-guide.org
```

This documentation structure covers all the major aspects of the CodeLibra project that we've discussed. The use of Org mode with tangle and Babel allows for:

1. Literate programming, where code and documentation are seamlessly integrated.
2. Easy execution of code blocks directly from the documentation.
3. Generation of diagrams (like the Mermaid diagram in architecture.org).
4. Exporting to various formats (HTML, PDF, etc.) for different audiences.

To make full use of this structure:

1. Ensure you have Emacs with Org mode installed.
2. Install necessary Babel languages (e.g., mermaid-mode for diagrams).
3. Use `C-c C-c` to execute code blocks in Org mode.
4. Use `C-c C-v t` to tangle code blocks to separate files.
5. Use `C-c C-e` to export the Org files to other formats as needed.

This structure provides a comprehensive, executable, and easily maintainable documentation set for the CodeLibra project. Would you like me to elaborate on any specific part of this documentation structure?
