    "title": "Design System Architecture",
    "description": "Design the overall system architecture for the MeetingSummarizer application, including the following components and considerations:\n\n1. Audio Capture and Processing: Mechanisms for capturing audio from meetings (e.g., microphones, video conferencing integrations) and preprocessing the audio data for speech recognition.\n* Consider using on-device processing (where feasible) to reduce bandwidth requirements, improve privacy, and offload processing from servers. Investigate edge computing solutions for real-time processing and reduced latency.\n\n2. Speech Recognition: Integration with a speech-to-text engine to transcribe the audio data into text.\n* Research open-source and commercially available speech-to-text engines for accuracy, cost, scalability, and on-device compatibility (where applicable). Additionally, explore the use of cloud-based services that offer real-time transcription.\n\n3. Natural Language Processing (NLP): NLP components for text summarization, entity extraction, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling.\n* Consider using pre-trained models or services for efficient implementation, and explore the use of custom training data to improve performance. Investigate transfer learning techniques to reduce training time and increase model accuracy.\n\n4. Data Storage: Database or storage solution for storing meeting transcripts, summaries, action items, and other relevant data.\n* Ensure the chosen storage solution supports scalability, can handle large volumes of data, and complies with GDPR and other privacy regulations. Additionally, consider using a distributed database system to improve performance and reduce potential single points of failure.\n\n5. User Interface: Web or mobile interface for users to access meeting summaries, action items, and other features.\n* Design a responsive and intuitive UI with a focus on usability, ensuring that it is accessible to users with disabilities. Implement progressive web applications (PWAs) for seamless cross-platform compatibility, and follow the latest accessibility guidelines such as WCAG 2.1.\n\n6. Integrations: Potential integrations with calendars, task management tools, or other productivity applications.\n* Research API documentation and consider compatibility with popular services, as well as the potential for custom integration solutions. Additionally, investigate using webhooks for real-time updates from integrated applications.\n\n7. Security and Privacy: Mechanisms for ensuring data privacy, access control, and secure storage of sensitive meeting information.\n* Implement end-to-end encryption for data in transit and at rest, and follow best practices for user authentication and authorization. Include a clear privacy policy for users to understand how their data is used and protected. Implement zero-knowledge proof systems to further enhance privacy protection.\n\n8. Scalability and Performance: Considerations for handling large volumes of audio data and ensuring efficient processing and retrieval of summaries.\n* Implement caching strategies to reduce the load on the system, improve performance, and minimize latency. Investigate using content delivery networks (CDNs) for distributing static content and reducing bandwidth requirements. Additionally, explore distributed computing solutions such as Kubernetes or Docker Swarm to handle increased load.\n\n9. Monitoring and Logging: Mechanisms for monitoring system health, logging errors, and tracking usage metrics.\n* Implement centralized logging with alerting and notifications based on critical error thresholds and regular reporting of key performance indicators (KPIs). Consider using tools like Splunk or Elasticsearch for log aggregation and analysis, as well as implementing machine learning algorithms to predict potential issues before they occur.\n\nThe architecture should be modular, extensible, and follow best practices for maintainability and testability. Once the design is complete, create a set of functional specifications for each component to guide implementation.",
