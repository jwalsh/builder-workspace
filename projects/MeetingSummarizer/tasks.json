    "description": "Design the overall system architecture for the MeetingSummarizer application, including the following components and considerations:\n\n1. Audio Capture and Processing: Mechanisms for capturing audio from meetings (e.g., microphones, video conferencing integrations) and preprocessing the audio data for speech recognition.\n* Consider using on-device processing to reduce bandwidth requirements and improve privacy.\n\n2. Speech Recognition: Integration with a speech-to-text engine to transcribe the audio data into text.\n* Research open-source and commercially available speech-to-text engines for accuracy, cost, and scalability.\n\n3. Natural Language Processing (NLP): NLP components for text summarization, entity extraction, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling.\n* Consider using pre-trained models or services for efficient implementation.\n\n4. Data Storage: Database or storage solution for storing meeting transcripts, summaries, action items, and other relevant data.\n* Ensure the chosen storage solution supports scalability and can handle large volumes of data.\n\n5. User Interface: Web or mobile interface for users to access meeting summaries, action items, and other features.\n* Design a responsive and intuitive UI with a focus on usability.\n\n6. Integrations: Potential integrations with calendars, task management tools, or other productivity applications.\n* Research API documentation and consider compatibility with popular services.\n\n7. Security and Privacy: Mechanisms for ensuring data privacy, access control, and secure storage of sensitive meeting information.\n* Implement end-to-end encryption for data in transit and at rest, and follow best practices for user authentication and authorization.\n\n8. Scalability and Performance: Considerations for handling large volumes of audio data and ensuring efficient processing and retrieval of summaries.\n* Implement caching strategies to reduce the load on the system and improve performance.\n\n9. Monitoring and Logging: Mechanisms for monitoring system health, logging errors, and tracking usage metrics.\n* Implement centralized logging with alerting and notifications based on critical error thresholds.\n\nThe architecture should be modular, extensible, and follow best practices for maintainability and testability. Once the design is complete, create a set of functional specifications for each component to guide implementation.",
