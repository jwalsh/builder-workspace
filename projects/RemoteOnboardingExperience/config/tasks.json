    "description": "Design the overall system architecture for the RemoteOnboardingExperience project. The system should be modular, maintainable, extendable, and follow best practices for cloud-native solutions. Consider microservices architecture, serverless functions where appropriate, and explore event-driven architecture for certain use cases (e.g., user events, notifications). Include a clear roadmap for future enhancements to accommodate future requirements, detailing potential technologies like GraphQL or gRPC for API development, and containerization using Docker or Kubernetes. Ensure the design supports high availability, disaster recovery, and observability. Address any edge cases or non-functional requirements such as performance, reliability, and security in the design. Provide a detailed analysis of the tradeoffs involved in each decision made during the design process. Update the document with UML diagrams for better visualization of the proposed architecture. Break down the task into smaller, manageable subtasks: (1) Architecture Planning and Design, (2) Microservices and Serverless Implementation, (3) Event-Driven Architecture Design, (4) API Development Strategy, (5) Containerization Strategy, (6) Disaster Recovery and Observability Strategy. Suggested improvements: (i) Include a section on data storage strategy, considering NoSQL databases for scalability and performance, and how it fits into the overall architecture design; (ii) Provide more detail on security measures, such as encryption at rest and in transit, access controls, and secure APIs; (iii) Discuss monitoring and logging strategies to ensure observability; (iv) Consider using infrastructure as code (IaC) tools like Terraform or CloudFormation for consistent and automated deployment. The current RFC is ready for the 'Design Review' state, so please update the 'rfc_state' field accordingly. Also, it would be beneficial to add subtasks for Security Design, Monitoring and Logging Strategy Implementation, Data Storage Strategy Implementation, and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Tool Implementation.",
