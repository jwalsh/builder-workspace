Specify APIs, data flows, and integration points. Address security, performance, and error handling requirements; include details on authentication, authorization, rate limiting, caching, and logging. Utilize containerized solutions like Docker and Kubernetes for deployment. Consider adding sections for testing strategies, documentation standards, accessibility guidelines, and post-deployment monitoring strategies. Provide examples or diagrams where necessary to aid in understanding the proposed design. Update the rfc_state field to 'IMPLEMENTATION_IN_PROGRESS' once work begins.",
