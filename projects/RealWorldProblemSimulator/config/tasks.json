    "description": "Define the scope, goals, and requirements for the RealWorldProblemSimulator project. This task involves gathering input from various stakeholders including instructors, students, and industry professionals to understand their needs and expectations. The requirements should cover the types of real-world scenarios to be simulated, the difficulty levels, the evaluation criteria, and the user experience for both problem creators and problem solvers. Additionally, consider scalability, maintainability, and integration with existing learning management systems or coding platforms. For the sake of clarity, this document is a DRAFT. Invite feedback from all relevant parties before finalizing. Once complete, assign to task-decomposer for breaking down tasks and estimating effort.",
