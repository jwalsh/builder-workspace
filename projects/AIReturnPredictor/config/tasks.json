    "description": "Design the overall system architecture, including data ingestion, processing, modeling, prediction components, and deployment strategies. The design should ensure scalability, fault tolerance, security aspects, monitoring/logging mechanisms, and address data privacy and compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, CCPA), data governance, and ethical considerations for AI systems. Outline the infrastructure requirements, cloud or on-premises deployment options, and cost estimates. Include a clear plan for handling sensitive customer data, considering anonymization techniques where necessary. The design should also address potential biases in the AI system and strategies for mitigating them, as well as provide insights into the choice of machine learning algorithms, data preprocessing methods, and performance benchmarks. Clarify the role of each component in the overall architecture, and define the interfaces between them. Incorporate feedback from the team and other stakeholders where necessary. The design should be adaptable to future enhancements and scalability requirements. Once approved, create a detailed implementation plan with timelines, milestones, and assigned resources. Update the RFC with this implementation plan and associated artifacts such as diagrams and documentation. If necessary, break down this task into smaller tasks for easier tracking and management.",
