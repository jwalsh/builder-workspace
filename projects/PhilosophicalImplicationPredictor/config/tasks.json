    "description": "Detailed documentation of the project requirements, encompassing specific technologies for analysis (e.g., AI, biotechnology, quantum computing), philosophical schools (e.g., deontology, consequentialism, utilitarianism) and ethical frameworks to be considered, desired output formats (e.g., report, visualization, API integration), necessary data sources or APIs for data collection, methods for contextualizing the implications of these emerging technologies within their respective fields, potential societal or cultural impacts, and any additional resources or constraints that may influence the project's scope. This document should serve as a foundation for further task decomposition and development. Considerations for scalability, maintainability, accessibility, and performance (response time, resource usage) are essential. Include a plan for continuous learning and adaptation of the model to accommodate new emerging technologies and advancements in philosophy and ethics. This document should be reviewed by the team, including the code-architect, project-manager, technical-writer, and potentially other roles such as data-scientist or philosopher. Include a plan for testing and validation of the model's predictions, addressing potential biases and ensuring ethical considerations in the development process.",
