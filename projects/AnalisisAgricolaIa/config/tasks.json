    "description": "Design the overall system architecture focusing on components for data ingestion, preprocessing, model training, prediction, and result visualization. Emphasize scalability, maintainability, performance optimizations, robust error handling, and edge case considerations. The design should incorporate a modular structure to facilitate easy upgrades and maintenance while also ensuring compliance with security best practices. Provide detailed documentation for each module and its interactions with others in the system. Upon completion, review the architecture with relevant stakeholders before moving forward with implementation.\n\nCollaborate closely with database-specialist, devops-engineer, and security-specialist during the design process as needed. Also, involve frontend-developer and backend-developer for input on user interface and API design respectively. Additionally, plan for A/B testing and monitoring performance metrics to ensure continuous improvement.\n\nUpon completion of the architecture design, update the relevant documentation (such as system diagrams and API specifications) and submit them to technical-writer for review before sharing with stakeholders.\n\nUpdate the following dependencies: [ 'Gather Requirements', 'Data Collection Strategy', 'UI/UX Design' ], and add 'Performance Optimization' and 'Error Handling' as additional considerations within the design scope.\n\nUpdate the rfc_state field to 'IN_PROGRESS' as it is now ready for implementation.",

Regular security audits, penetration testing, and multi-factor authentication should be performed whenever possible. It's crucial to document all implemented security measures in the Security Guide for future reference. This task is further divided into subtasks: OAuth2.0 implementation, RBAC and ACL implementation, data encryption setup, secure communication configuration, input validation, industry standards compliance, security audits, penetration testing, multi-factor authentication setup, and incorporating security testing as part of the Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline. This task also includes consulting with security experts for best practices and potential risks, and ensuring regular updates and patches, and monitoring for any emerging security threats or vulnerabilities. Update the task dependencies to include 'Design System Architecture', 'Security Best Practices Research' and assign this task to the 'security-specialist' for further progress.",

    "description": "Implement a comprehensive testing framework that includes unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests, and performance tests to ensure system quality, reliability, and efficiency. This will involve designing test cases, implementing them, executing them, and maintaining them. Consider using existing testing libraries or tools (such as Jest, Mocha, Cypress, Selenium) to streamline the process. It is also recommended to include automated UI tests for a more robust testing suite, prioritize test coverage for critical system functions, and ensure test coverage for edge cases. Upon implementation, documentation of the testing framework should be provided for future reference. Additionally, consider incorporating continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) practices to automate the testing and deployment process. To enhance the efficiency of the task, it would be beneficial to break down this task into smaller, manageable sub-tasks, such as: selecting the appropriate testing tools, designing test cases, writing tests, implementing CI/CD pipeline, and documenting the testing framework. Upon completion of each sub-task, document the progress and share with the team. To improve clarity and efficiency, I suggest adding a timeline for each sub-task and specify any particular libraries or tools that will be used.",

Clarify the deployment environment details. Ensure that the system is designed with a focus on resilience and high availability. Suggested improvements: Clearly define dependencies, suggested improvements for each sub-task, and add a 'Security Measures Implementation' sub-task under 'Implement Security Measures' dependency. Include specific security measures such as encryption at rest and in transit, network segmentation, regular vulnerability scanning, and secure access controls. Furthermore, suggest dividing the 'Test Disaster Recovery Plan' into separate tasks for testing different phases of the disaster recovery process.",
