Emphasize scalability, maintainability, performance optimizations, robust error handling, and edge case considerations. The design should incorporate a modular structure to facilitate easy upgrades and maintenance while also ensuring compliance with security best practices. Provide detailed documentation for each module and its interactions with others in the system. Upon completion, review the architecture with relevant stakeholders before moving forward with implementation. (Consult with database-specialist, devops-engineer, and security-specialist during the design process as needed.)",
