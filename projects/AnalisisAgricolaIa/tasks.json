Emphasize scalability, maintainability, performance optimizations, robust error handling, and edge case considerations. The design should incorporate a modular structure to facilitate easy upgrades and maintenance while also ensuring compliance with security best practices. Provide detailed documentation for each module and its interactions with others in the system. Upon completion, review the architecture with relevant stakeholders before moving forward with implementation.\n\nCollaborate closely with database-specialist, devops-engineer, and security-specialist during the design process as needed. Also, consider involving frontend-developer and backend-developer for input on user interface and API design respectively.\n\nUpon completion of the architecture design, update the relevant documentation (such as system diagrams and API specifications) and submit them to technical-writer for review before sharing with stakeholders.",

Additionally, ensure compliance with relevant industry standards such as GDPR, HIPAA, or PCI DSS where applicable. Also, consider performing regular security audits, penetration testing, and implementing multi-factor authentication wherever possible. Lastly, document all implemented security measures in the Security Guide for future reference. If necessary, consult with security experts for best practices and potential risks. Suggestion: It might be beneficial to specify the exact implementation methods for each security measure (e.g., OAuth2.0 for authentication).
