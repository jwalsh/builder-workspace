    "title": "Define Project Scope and Requirements (Revised)",
    "description": "In this revised RFC for the AICodeReviewer system, we will specify the detailed requirements. The scope includes automated analysis of pull requests for syntax checks, adherence to style guidelines, unit testing, security vulnerability detection, performance optimization, and code complexity measurement. Additionally, we outline support for popular programming languages (Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, etc.) and frameworks, while suggesting a minimalistic and intuitive user interface (UI) design that focuses on usability, accessibility, and scalability. The system will integrate with popular version control systems like GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab, and will require APIs for integration with other tools such as continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) tools, bug tracking systems, and code quality analysis tools. Future integrations may include machine learning models for more advanced analysis. For UI design, consider a dashboard that displays pull requests, issues, and suggested improvements in an easily navigable format. In terms of security, implement strong data encryption, access controls, and regular security audits. This RFC incorporates the following improvements from the review process: 1) Clarification that the system should also support code refactoring suggestions, 2) Metrics for measuring performance optimization and code complexity (e.g., lines of code, cyclomatic complexity), 3) Automatic unit test generation using tools like pytest, Mocha, Jest, or TestNG, 4) A feature for manual code review by human experts when necessary, 5) Integration with popular linters such as ESLint, Flake8, and CheckStyle. Additionally, I suggest integrating with static analysis tools like SonarQube or CodeClimate for comprehensive code quality analysis, and including the ability to integrate with other static analysis tools based on customer requirements. The RFC is currently in the APPROVED state, assigned to the code-architect. With these revisions addressed, the RFC can progress to the 'IMPLEMENTATION' state.",

    "title": "Design System Architecture (Revised and Expanded) - RFC Review and Suggestions",
    "description": "This revised RFC proposes a detailed design of the overall architecture of the AICodeReviewer system. The main components, their interactions, data flow, integration points, and communication protocols are described below, considering scalability, performance, security, maintainability, modularity, extensibility, and monitoring/logging concerns. The following components are addressed: a web-based user interface, a code analysis engine, a code repository integration, a database for storing analysis results and project data, a notification system, and a real-time analysis component (if feasible). In addition, a detailed plan for implementing the design is provided, including estimates for time and resources required. This RFC also addresses error handling strategies, disaster recovery plans, and potential future integrations with other tools or services.\n\n**Component Details:**\n- Web-based User Interface: The use of modern frontend frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js is recommended, ensuring responsive design and adhering to accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1) while maintaining a focus on usability.\n- Code Analysis Engine: Discuss the AI models to be used in detail, explaining how they will be developed (e.g., supervised learning, unsupervised learning), their maintenance plans, and any open-source libraries that may be utilized for specific tasks. Additionally, consider including a plan for continuous improvement of the code analysis engine. In addition, suggest using version control systems like Git to manage the development and deployment of AI models.\n- Code Repository Integration: Provide information on the APIs or hooks to be used for integration with popular code repositories such as GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitLab, addressing support for both public and private repositories. Also, consider including a plan for handling repository updates and changes, and address the use of webhooks for real-time notifications.\n- Database: Include the proposed database schema, normalization strategies, indexing techniques, and data modeling best practices. Consider using a managed service like AWS RDS or Azure SQL for scalability and ease of maintenance. Additionally, provide a strategy for ensuring efficient data backup and recovery, and suggest using cloud services for disaster recovery.\n- Notification System: Explain the use of Webhooks or other methods for real-time notifications, discuss customizable notification preferences, and consider providing an in-app messaging system to allow team members to communicate. Also, suggest strategies for handling user subscription management and email deliverability, and address the need for two-factor authentication.\n- Real-time Analysis Component (if feasible): Clearly outline the technical challenges associated with real-time analysis, proposed solutions, and expected performance implications. If it is not feasible at launch, suggest a timeline for adding this feature in the future. In addition, discuss potential strategies for minimizing latency and ensuring high availability, and suggest using edge computing or caching to reduce server load.\n\n**Implementation Plan:**[Details...] \n\n**Considerations:**[Error handling strategies, disaster recovery plans, future integrations, testing and validation strategies...]\n\n**Assigned To**: project-manager",
