    "description": "In this revised RFC for the AICodeReviewer system, we will specify the detailed requirements. The scope includes automated analysis of pull requests for syntax checks, adherence to style guidelines, unit testing, security vulnerability detection, performance optimization, and code complexity measurement. Additionally, we outline support for popular programming languages (Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, etc.) and frameworks, while suggesting a minimalistic and intuitive user interface (UI) design that focuses on usability, accessibility, and scalability. The system will integrate with popular version control systems like GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab, and will require APIs for integration with other tools such as continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) tools, bug tracking systems, and code quality analysis tools. Future integrations may include machine learning models for more advanced analysis. For UI design, consider a dashboard that displays pull requests, issues, and suggested improvements in an easily navigable format. In terms of security, implement strong data encryption, access controls, and regular security audits. This RFC is currently in REVIEW state, assigned to the code-architect.",

    "description": "This revised RFC proposes a detailed design of the overall architecture of the AICodeReviewer system. The main components, their interactions, data flow, integration points, and communication protocols are described below, considering scalability, performance, security, maintainability, modularity, extensibility, and monitoring/logging concerns. The following components are addressed: a web-based user interface, a code analysis engine, a code repository integration, a database for storing analysis results and project data, a notification system, and a real-time analysis component (if feasible). In addition, a detailed plan for implementing the design is provided, including estimates for time and resources required. This RFC also addresses error handling strategies, disaster recovery plans, and potential future integrations with other tools or services.\n\n**Component Details:**\n- Web-based User Interface: Provide more details on the technologies to be used (e.g., frontend frameworks), responsive design considerations, and accessibility standards to ensure an inclusive user experience.\n- Code Analysis Engine: Clarify the algorithms and AI models to be used for code analysis, and explain how these will be trained and maintained.\n- Code Repository Integration: Detail the specific APIs or hooks to be used for integration with popular code repositories such as GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitLab.\n- Database: Provide more details on the database schema, including normalization strategies, indexing techniques, and data modeling best practices.\n- Notification System: Explain the use of Webhooks or other methods for real-time notifications, and discuss the potential need for customizable notification preferences.\n- Real-time Analysis Component (if feasible): Clearly outline the technical challenges associated with real-time analysis, proposed solutions, and expected performance implications.\n\n**Implementation Plan:**[Details...] \n\n**Considerations:**[Error handling strategies, disaster recovery plans, future integrations...]\n\n**Assigned To**: code-architect",
