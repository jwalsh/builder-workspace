This includes identifying the types of code analysis to be performed, such as syntax checks, style guidelines enforcement, unit testing, security vulnerabilities detection, and performance optimization. Additionally, outline the programming languages and frameworks supported, desired user interface (UI) design, integration points with existing tools like GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab, and any necessary API requirements. Furthermore, consider accessibility standards, scalability, and potential future integrations.",

Include detailed descriptions of the main components, their interactions, data flow, and integration points. Consider scalability, performance, security, and maintainability concerns. The following components should be addressed: a web-based user interface, a code analysis engine, a code repository integration, a database for storing analysis results and project data, and a notification system. Address the following additional considerations: modularity, extensibility, and monitoring/logging. Update the design to support real-time analysis where feasible.",
