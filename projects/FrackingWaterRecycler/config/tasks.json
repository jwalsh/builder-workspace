Consider scalability, fault tolerance, security, and maintainability aspects. Include a detailed design document that covers all the mentioned aspects and provides a clear roadmap for implementation. The design should also address the environmental impact of the system, energy efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. The design document should be structured in a way that it can be easily understood by both technical and non-technical stakeholders. Additionally, consider implementing modularity for easy maintenance, optimizing the system for minimum water loss, and exploring potential partnerships or collaborations with eco-friendly technology providers to improve the sustainability of the system.",
