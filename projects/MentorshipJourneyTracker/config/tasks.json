    "title": "Design System Architecture",
    "description": "Design the overall system architecture, including the frontend, backend, and database components, as well as the communication between them. Consider the following aspects:\n\n1. Scalability: The system should be able to handle a growing number of users and data without compromising performance.\n2. Modularity: The architecture should be modular, allowing for easy maintenance, updates, and integration of new features.\n3. Security: Implement appropriate security measures to protect user data and ensure privacy. Include considerations for authentication, authorization, and encryption of sensitive data. Consider using OAuth or similar standards for authentication.\n4. User Experience: Design the architecture with a focus on providing a seamless and intuitive user experience for both mentors and mentees. This includes considerations for responsive design, accessibility, and performance optimization.\n5. Data Storage: Determine the appropriate database solution (SQL or NoSQL) based on the data structure and querying requirements. Consider using a combination of databases for different use cases to optimize performance and scalability.\n6. Caching: Implement caching mechanisms to improve performance and reduce database load, with emphasis on proper cache invalidation strategies to ensure data consistency. Redis or Memcached could be suitable choices.\n7. Monitoring and Logging: Incorporate monitoring and logging systems for tracking application health, performance, and debugging. These should include metrics collection, log aggregation, and alerting using tools like Prometheus and Grafana.\n8. Edge Cases and Error Handling: Consider common edge cases and error scenarios to ensure graceful handling of unexpected events and maintain system stability. Implement robust exception handling and logging mechanisms.\n9. Documentation: Create clear documentation for the architecture design, including technical specifications, design decisions, and rationale. This should be easily accessible and understandable for team members with varying levels of expertise.\n10. Performance Testing: Perform thorough performance testing to ensure that the system can handle expected loads without compromising user experience. Additionally, consider conducting stress tests to evaluate the system's performance under heavy load.\n\n**Updated Fields:**\n\n- The 'assigned_to' field has been updated to 'code-architect' for initial review and task decomposition.\n- The 'rfc_state' field has been updated to 'IN_PROGRESS', indicating that the RFC is currently being worked on.\n- The 'task_type' field has been updated to 'Design Document'. This is because this RFC serves as a high-level design document for the project architecture rather than a task for implementation.\n",
