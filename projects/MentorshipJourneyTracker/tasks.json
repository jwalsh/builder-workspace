    "description": "Design the overall system architecture, including the frontend, backend, and database components, as well as the communication between them. Consider the following aspects:\n\n1. Scalability: The system should be able to handle a growing number of users and data without compromising performance.\n2. Modularity: The architecture should be modular, allowing for easy maintenance, updates, and integration of new features.\n3. Security: Implement appropriate security measures to protect user data and ensure privacy. Include considerations for authentication, authorization, and encryption of sensitive data.\n4. User Experience: Design the architecture with a focus on providing a seamless and intuitive user experience for both mentors and mentees. This includes considerations for responsive design, accessibility, and performance optimization.\n5. Data Storage: Determine the appropriate database solution (SQL or NoSQL) based on the data structure and querying requirements. Consider using a combination of databases for different use cases to optimize performance and scalability.\n6. Caching: Implement caching mechanisms to improve performance and reduce database load, with emphasis on proper cache invalidation strategies to ensure data consistency.\n7. Monitoring and Logging: Incorporate monitoring and logging systems for tracking application health, performance, and debugging. These should include metrics collection, log aggregation, and alerting.\n8. Edge Cases and Error Handling: Consider common edge cases and error scenarios to ensure graceful handling of unexpected events and maintain system stability.\n9. Documentation: Create clear documentation for the architecture design, including technical specifications, design decisions, and rationale.",
