Scalability: The system should be able to handle a growing number of users and data without compromising performance.\n2. Modularity: The architecture should be modular, allowing for easy maintenance, updates, and integration of new features.\n3. Security: Implement appropriate security measures to protect user data and ensure privacy.\n4. User Experience: Design the architecture with a focus on providing a seamless and intuitive user experience for both mentors and mentees.\n5. Data Storage: Determine the appropriate database solution (SQL or NoSQL) based on the data structure and querying requirements.\n6. Caching: Implement caching mechanisms to improve performance and reduce database load.\n7. Monitoring and Logging: Incorporate monitoring and logging systems for tracking application health, performance, and debugging.",
