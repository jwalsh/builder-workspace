The solution should support real-time querying and data retrieval. Consider using a hybrid database system (e.g., combining NoSQL for unstructured data like user interactions and SQL for structured data like performance metrics). To handle the different data types and workloads, consider sharding or partitioning the data. Ensure data redundancy, backup, and disaster recovery mechanisms are in place, including periodic snapshots and asynchronous replication. Additionally, explore potential integration with a time-series database for handling high-velocity time-stamped data. Update the solution design to clearly outline how this will be achieved.",
