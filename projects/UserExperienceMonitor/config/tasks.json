This design will include backend, frontend, data storage components, communication and integration mechanisms. The design should address scalability, fault tolerance, and security considerations for the specified project requirements. A detailed diagram and documentation explaining the different components, their responsibilities, and how they interact with each other will be provided. The chosen technologies and their rationales, considering the project's requirements and constraints, will also be included. This RFC is in DRAFT state and requires review and comments from assigned team members. The document is prepared by code-architect, and suggestions for improvements are welcomed.",

    "description": "Design and implement a scalable, reliable, and efficient data storage solution. This includes performance metrics, user interactions, and sentiment analysis data. The solution should support real-time querying and data retrieval. Consider using a hybrid database system (e.g., combining NoSQL for unstructured data like user interactions and SQL for structured data like performance metrics). To handle the different data types and workloads, consider sharding or partitioning the data based on the specific requirements of each component. Ensure data redundancy, backup, and disaster recovery mechanisms are in place, including periodic snapshots and asynchronous replication. Additionally, explore potential integration with a time-series database for handling high-velocity time-stamped data. However, it is recommended to also investigate other relevant databases such as Cassandra or Redis for specific use cases (e.g., real-time processing). Update the solution design to clearly outline how this will be achieved, including a comparison of various options and justifications for the chosen approach. Mention the potential trade-offs in terms of performance, cost, and maintainability. Once the design is finalized, initiate the implementation phase with the appropriate team members (e.g., backend-developer). After completion of the implementation, validate the solution through testing and quality assurance procedures.",
