This includes: \n1. A clear definition of the system components to be included in the model's monitoring with specific focus on both software and hardware elements.\n2. Description of the key performance indicators (KPIs) or specific metrics that will be considered for each component, highlighting any industry-standard metrics as well as custom ones.\n3. Explanation of the desired format and frequency of health scores output, considering real-time, batch, or scheduled updates.\n4. Any additional considerations such as edge cases, error handling, system constraints, potential integration points with other systems, scalability requirements, and data privacy concerns.",

    "description": "Design the overall architecture of the SystemHealthScorer, including the data pipeline, the machine learning model, and the integration with the monitored systems. Consider the following aspects:\n\n1. Data ingestion and preprocessing: Define the mechanisms for collecting and preprocessing the system metrics data from various sources, including real-time streaming and batch processing methods.\n2. Data storage: Determine the appropriate data storage solution (e.g., relational database, NoSQL database, data lake) based on the volume, velocity, and variety of the data, considering scalability and cost efficiency.\n3. Machine learning model: Specify the type of machine learning model (e.g., supervised, unsupervised, deep learning) and the algorithms to be used for health score prediction, discussing the trade-offs between accuracy and computation complexity.\n4. Model training and evaluation: Design the process for training and evaluating the machine learning model, including data splitting, cross-validation, and performance metrics, considering the impact of imbalanced classes and outliers.\n5. Model deployment: Plan for deploying the trained model in a production environment, considering scalability, fault tolerance, and monitoring, discussing containerization technologies like Docker or Kubernetes.\n6. Integration with monitored systems: Define the interfaces and protocols for integrating the SystemHealthScorer with the systems being monitored, ensuring secure and efficient data exchange, including API design and documentation.\n7. User interface: Outline the requirements for a user-friendly web application that allows administrators to view and manage the system health scores and related information, discussing responsiveness and accessibility considerations.\n8. Logging and monitoring: Incorporate mechanisms for logging and monitoring the SystemHealthScorer components to ensure proper operation and troubleshooting capabilities, including alerting systems and dashboards.\n9. Security considerations: Address potential security vulnerabilities in the system architecture, including data encryption, authentication, and authorization.",
