Consider the following aspects:\n\n1. Data ingestion and preprocessing: Define the mechanisms for collecting and preprocessing the system metrics data from various sources.\n2. Data storage: Determine the appropriate data storage solution (e.g., relational database, NoSQL database, data lake) based on the volume, velocity, and variety of the data.\n3. Machine learning model: Specify the type of machine learning model (e.g., supervised, unsupervised, deep learning) and the algorithms to be used for health score prediction.\n4. Model training and evaluation: Design the process for training and evaluating the machine learning model, including data splitting, cross-validation, and performance metrics.\n5. Model deployment: Plan for deploying the trained model in a production environment, considering scalability, fault tolerance, and monitoring.\n6. Integration with monitored systems: Define the interfaces and protocols for integrating the SystemHealthScorer with the systems being monitored, ensuring secure and efficient data exchange.\n7. User interface: Outline the requirements for a user interface that allows administrators to view and manage the system health scores and related information.\n8. Logging and monitoring: Incorporate mechanisms for logging and monitoring the SystemHealthScorer components to ensure proper operation and troubleshooting capabilities.",
