    "description": "Gather and document the detailed requirements for the DataPageSeeker project, including the following key aspects:\n\n1. Data Sources: Identify the specific purpose-built databases and their schemas that will be used as data sources for the application, along with the APIs or connectors required to access these databases. Include any necessary details about data format, expected data volume, and performance considerations.\n\n2. Search Functionality: Define the search criteria and filters that users will be able to apply to the data, such as keyword search, date range, and any other relevant filters. Consider edge cases like spelling variations, wildcard searches, and complex queries, and discuss strategies for handling them efficiently.\n\n3. Pagination: Specify the requirements for paginating the search results, including the number of items per page, navigation controls, and any other relevant pagination features. Additionally, consider infinite scrolling as an alternative or additional option, and discuss trade-offs between the two approaches.\n\n4. Data Transformation: Outline the necessary data transformations or aggregations that need to be performed on the data before presenting it to the user. This should include error handling strategies for unexpected data formats or inconsistencies, and discuss potential techniques for dealing with these issues.\n\n5. User Interface (UI): Describe the desired UI for the searchable, paginated list, including the layout, design, and any specific UI/UX requirements. Provide wireframes or mockups where applicable, and discuss accessibility considerations.\n\n6. Performance and Scalability: Identify any specific performance and scalability requirements, such as expected data volumes, concurrent user loads, and any other relevant factors. Discuss strategies for caching, indexing, and optimizing SQL queries to ensure efficient data retrieval, and evaluate the impact of these strategies on overall performance.\n\n7. Security and Access Control (AC): Define any security and access control requirements, such as user authentication, data encryption, and role-based access controls. Include OAuth or JWT implementations where appropriate, and discuss potential security risks and mitigation strategies.\n\n8. Integrations: Identify any external systems or APIs that need to be integrated with the application, along with their documentation and any necessary API keys or credentials. Discuss any challenges or constraints associated with these integrations.\n\n9. Reporting and Analytics (RA): Specify any reporting or analytics requirements, such as generating reports or visualizations based on the search results. Consider using popular data analysis libraries like Tableau or PowerBI for exporting results, and discuss potential limitations and opportunities.\n\n10. Testing and Quality Assurance (TQA): Outline the testing and quality assurance requirements, including unit testing, integration testing, and any other relevant testing strategies. This should include functional testing, performance testing, security testing, usability testing, and discuss any testing tools or frameworks that might be suitable.\n\nThe updated RFC is ready for the next state. Update the 'rfc_state' field accordingly.",
