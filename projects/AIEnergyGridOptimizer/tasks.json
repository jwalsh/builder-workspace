    "description": "Collect, document, and categorize the requirements for the AIEnergyGridOptimizer system. This includes input data sources (smart meters, weather data, grid infrastructure data, renewable energy sources), desired outputs (optimal energy distribution plan, forecasted demand, cost optimization), performance metrics (response time, accuracy, system uptime), and constraints (regulatory compliance, budget, data privacy, security). Additionally, clarify any ambiguous or missing requirements by providing clear examples and use cases where possible. The goal is to ensure the requirements are comprehensive and address all necessary aspects of the system.\n\nTo help with this task, it may be beneficial to break down the requirements into smaller, more manageable tasks if they prove to be extensive. This will facilitate a more organized and efficient approach to gathering and documenting the requirements.",
