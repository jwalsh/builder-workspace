    "description": "Gather and document the functional and non-functional requirements for the DistributedTracingAnalyzer system. The requirements should cover the following aspects:\n\n1. Data ingestion: Specify the expected format, volume, and velocity of the distributed tracing data, including supported trace formats such as Jaeger, Zipkin, etc.\n2. Data processing: Define the required processing steps, such as data cleaning, normalization, and enrichment, including any pre-processing steps for specific trace formats. Consider edge cases and potential issues that may arise during processing.\n3. Analysis: Identify the types of performance bottlenecks and security issues to be detected, and the analysis techniques to be employed, considering machine learning algorithms where appropriate. Provide details on the approach for detecting these issues and any benchmarks or thresholds used.\n4. Reporting and visualization: Specify the desired output formats (e.g., dashboards, reports) and the level of detail required for both developers and system administrators. Consider customizability options to accommodate different users' needs.\n5. Scalability and performance: Define the expected load and performance requirements, including response times and throughput for different scales of data and number of users. Provide details on the architecture and any necessary optimizations to ensure scalability.\n6. Security and compliance: Outline any relevant security and compliance requirements, such as data encryption (at-rest and in-transit), access controls (RBAC or similar), auditing, and privacy considerations. Include details on secure data storage and transmission methods.\n7. Integration: Identify any external systems or services that need to be integrated with the DistributedTracingAnalyzer, including monitoring tools, CI/CD pipelines, and potential data sources. Provide a clear plan for integration and any dependencies.\n8. Operational requirements: Specify the deployment, monitoring, and maintenance needs of the system, considering both on-premises and cloud deployments. Include details on the installation process, configuration options, and any required updates or patches.\n9. Testing and validation: Outline the testing strategy for the DistributedTracingAnalyzer, including unit tests, integration tests, and system tests.",
