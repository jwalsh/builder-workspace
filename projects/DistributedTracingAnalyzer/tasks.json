    "description": "Gather and document the functional and non-functional requirements for the DistributedTracingAnalyzer system. The requirements should cover the following aspects:\n\n1. Data ingestion: Specify the expected format, volume, and velocity of the distributed tracing data.\n2. Data processing: Define the required processing steps, such as data cleaning, normalization, and enrichment.\n3. Analysis: Identify the types of performance bottlenecks and security issues to be detected, and the analysis techniques to be employed.\n4. Reporting and visualization: Specify the desired output formats (e.g., dashboards, reports) and the level of detail required.\n5. Scalability and performance: Define the expected load and performance requirements, including response times and throughput.\n6. Security and compliance: Outline any relevant security and compliance requirements, such as data encryption, access controls, and audit logging.\n7. Integration: Identify any external systems or services that need to be integrated with the DistributedTracingAnalyzer.\n8. Operational requirements: Specify the deployment, monitoring, and maintenance needs of the system.",
