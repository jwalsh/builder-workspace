    "description": "Design the overall system architecture for the advanced deception technology project. This includes defining components, interfaces, and data flows. Propose AI models (GANs, reinforcement learning, anomaly detection) for creating and managing decoys, discuss scalability, fault tolerance, security considerations, performance requirements, integration with existing security tools and processes (e.g., SIEM, IDS/IPS), and deployment strategies (e.g., cloud, on-premises). Outline monitoring, maintenance, and error handling procedures, considering edge cases and performance optimizations. Clarify dependencies on 'Requirements Gathering and Analysis' and any other potential dependencies. Also, suggest techniques for data privacy preservation in the deception system, provide a high-level architecture diagram, perform initial proof-of-concept implementations of key components or algorithms, if possible. Suggest incorporating machine learning models (such as Autoencoders and LSTM) to enhance AI capabilities. However, consider the trade-off between deception realism and computational resources. Incorporate techniques for efficient data storage and retrieval, such as data compression and indexing. Lastly, provide a detailed breakdown of tasks that can be delegated to different team members (frontend-developer, backend-developer, database-specialist, devops-engineer, etc.). Update the rfc_state field to 'READY_FOR_IMPLEMENTATION' once the review is complete and any necessary improvements have been addressed.",

Consider edge cases such as high concurrency, varying data sizes, and potential data anomalies. Data models should include decoy configurations, attacker profiles, attack patterns, and analytics. Ensure scalability, performance, security best practices, and data integrity. Incorporate encryption and access control mechanisms for sensitive data. Define data retention policies, backup strategies, disaster recovery plans, and compliance with relevant data privacy and security regulations including GDPR, HIPAA, CCPA, and any other applicable laws. Provide documentation for each data model and design decision made. Include a plan for performance testing and benchmarking the database design. Due to the sensitive nature of this task, it is recommended to assign both a Database Specialist and a Security Specialist to ensure compliance with security standards. Since this task involves complex data handling, it would be beneficial to have the Project Manager's input in the task decomposition process. For documentation purposes, the Technical Writer should also be involved.
