    "description": "This RFC proposes the design of a database schema for storing and managing decoy data, attacker behavior, logs, and other relevant information. The database design should consider edge cases such as high concurrency, varying data sizes, potential data anomalies, and scalability. Data models will include decoy configurations, attacker profiles, attack patterns, analytics, encryption, access control mechanisms for sensitive data, data retention policies, backup strategies, disaster recovery plans, and compliance with relevant data privacy and security regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA, CCPA.\n\n**Data Models:**\n- Decoy configurations\n- Attacker profiles\n- Attack patterns\n- Analytics\n\n**Security Considerations:**\n- Encryption for sensitive data\n- Access control mechanisms\n\n**Data Management:**\n- Data retention policies\n- Backup strategies\n- Disaster recovery plans\n\n**Compliance:**\n- Relevant data privacy and security regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, CCPA)\n\n**Documentation:**\n- Document each data model and design decision made\n- Include a plan for performance testing and benchmarking the database design due to the sensitive nature of this task, it is recommended to assign both a Database Specialist and a Security Specialist. Since this task involves complex data handling, the Project Manager's input will be crucial in the task decomposition process. For documentation purposes, the Technical Writer should also be involved.\n\nTo improve readability, please consider breaking down the description into smaller, more manageable sections and using bullet points where appropriate.",
