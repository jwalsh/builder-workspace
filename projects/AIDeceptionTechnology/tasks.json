Outline monitoring, maintenance, and error handling procedures, considering edge cases and performance optimizations. Clarify dependencies on 'Requirements Gathering and Analysis' and any other potential dependencies. Also, suggest techniques for data privacy preservation in the deception system and provide a high-level architecture diagram. If possible, perform initial proof-of-concept implementations of key components or algorithms.",

Ensure scalability, performance, security best practices, and data integrity. Incorporate encryption and access control mechanisms for sensitive data. Define data retention policies, backup strategies, disaster recovery plans, and compliance with relevant data privacy and security regulations including GDPR, HIPAA, CCPA, and any other applicable laws. Provide documentation for each data model and design decision made. Include a plan for performance testing and benchmarking the database design.
