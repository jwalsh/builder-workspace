Propose AI models (GANs, reinforcement learning, anomaly detection) for creating and managing decoys, discuss scalability, fault tolerance, security considerations, performance requirements, integration with existing security tools and processes (e.g., SIEM, IDS/IPS), and deployment strategies (e.g., cloud, on-premises). Outline monitoring, maintenance, and error handling procedures, considering edge cases and performance optimizations. Clarify dependencies on 'Requirements Gathering and Analysis' and any other potential dependencies. Also, suggest techniques for data privacy preservation in the deception system, provide a high-level architecture diagram, perform initial proof-of-concept implementations of key components or algorithms, if possible. Provide recommendations on modularization for future expansion or maintenance. Update the rfc_state field to 'READY_FOR_IMPLEMENTATION' once the review is complete and any necessary improvements have been addressed.",

Define data retention policies, backup strategies, disaster recovery plans, and compliance with relevant data privacy and security regulations including GDPR, HIPAA, CCPA, and any other applicable laws. Provide documentation for each data model and design decision made. Include a plan for performance testing and benchmarking the database design.
