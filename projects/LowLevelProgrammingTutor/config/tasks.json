    "description": "Gather and document comprehensive requirements for the LowLevelProgrammingTutor platform. Target audience includes professionals, students, and hobbyists. Cover essential low-level programming concepts such as assembly language, memory management, with potential inclusion of C or C++. Desired features encompass an interactive code editor, debugging tools, project templates, and learning objectives focus on understanding hardware, performance optimization, etc. Consider preferences for platform layout, design, and user experience. Also, consider potential collaboration and community-building aspects, including forums, chat rooms, and sharing of user-created projects. In the scope of this task, also define the project's milestones, timelines, and release plan. Finally, create a glossary of terms to assist users who are new to low-level programming.",
