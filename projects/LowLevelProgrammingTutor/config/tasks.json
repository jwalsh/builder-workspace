    "description": "Revise and expand the comprehensive requirements for the LowLevelProgrammingTutor platform. Target audience includes professionals, students, and hobbyists interested in low-level programming. The scope covers essential concepts such as assembly language, memory management, potential inclusion of C or C++, interactive code editor, debugging tools, project templates, learning objectives focused on hardware understanding, performance optimization, etc. Additionally, consider preferences for platform layout, design, and user experience. Address potential collaboration and community-building aspects, including forums, chat rooms, and sharing of user-created projects. Define the project's milestones, timelines, and release plan. In the scope of this task, also create a glossary of terms to assist users who are new to low-level programming, as well as include a section on security considerations for teaching and practicing low-level programming. Furthermore, emphasize on creating an intuitive interface and comprehensive learning paths, focusing on both theoretical knowledge and practical applications. Update the 'assigned_to' field to 'task-decomposer' for further task decomposition.",

    "description": "Finalize the overall system architecture design for the LowLevelProgrammingTutor platform. This includes a detailed breakdown of frontend, backend, database components, APIs, necessary integrations or third-party services. The design should be scalable, flexible, and performance-optimized, with an emphasis on security measures. Provide diagrams where appropriate to aid understanding. Revisions include: 1. Incorporate microservices architecture for improved scalability and flexibility. 2. Utilize containerization for better deployment and management. 3. Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms (OAuth2 or JWT). 4. Ensure data encryption at rest and in transit (AES-256, SSL/TLS). 5. Implement rate limiting and CAPTCHA for security purposes. Also, consider implementing logging, monitoring, and alerting systems to ensure system health and performance. 6. For the frontend, ensure that it is built using a modern framework (e.g., React or Angular) and follows best practices in terms of accessibility, responsiveness, and cross-browser compatibility.",
