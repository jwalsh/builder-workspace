Consider scalability, fault tolerance, security aspects (including compliance with relevant regulations such as data privacy laws), integration with external data sources (e.g., real estate databases, market data providers) and API endpoints for seamless frontend interaction. Provide a detailed architecture diagram, documentation, and a clear delineation of system components' responsibilities. Ensure the design is modular and extensible to accommodate future updates and improvements. Prioritize performance optimization, ensuring low latency for real-time property valuations. Consider using containerization technologies (e.g., Docker) for better scalability, and adopt microservices architecture for better modularity. Furthermore, consider implementing serverless functions for cost efficiency and auto-scaling capabilities. Lastly, include a thorough testing strategy to ensure system reliability and stability. Suggest incorporating monitoring and logging mechanisms for observability and troubleshooting purposes. Also, consider using version control systems for managing code changes and ensuring smooth collaboration among team members.",
