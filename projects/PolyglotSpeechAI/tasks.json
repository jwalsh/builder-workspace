    "description": "Detailed requirements gathering for the PolyglotSpeechAI project: \n1. Supported audio formats (MP3, WAV, FLAC, etc.) \n2. Languages supported (English, Spanish, Mandarin, Arabic, Hindi, etc.) \n3. Transcription accuracy targets (>95% for English, >90% for other languages) \n4. Translation quality expectations (BLEU score > 80%) \n5. Desired insights/comprehension features (sentiment analysis, entity recognition, topic modeling, etc.) \n6. Data privacy and security considerations (anonymization, encryption at rest and in transit, GDPR compliance, etc.) \n7. Scalability requirements (able to process 1000 audio files per hour initially, scaling up to 5000 files within a year) \n8. Integration with existing systems or third-party services (Google Cloud Speech-to-Text, Microsoft Azure Text Translation, etc.)",
