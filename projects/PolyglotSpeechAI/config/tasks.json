    "description": "Detailed requirements gathering for the PolyglotSpeechAI project:\n1. Supported audio formats (MP3, WAV, FLAC, etc.) \n2. Languages supported (English, Spanish, Mandarin, Arabic, Hindi, French, German, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Portuguese)\n3. Transcription accuracy targets (>95% for English, >85% for other languages)\n4. Translation quality expectations (BLEU score > 80%, human-level performance in English and target language within top quartile)\n5. Desired insights/comprehension features (sentiment analysis, entity recognition, topic modeling, speech-to-text speed adjustment, text-to-speech conversion, keyword spotting)\n6. Data privacy and security considerations (anonymization, encryption at rest and in transit, GDPR compliance, CCPA compliance, HIPAA compliance if applicable, secure data storage solutions)\n7. Scalability requirements (able to process 1000 audio files per hour initially, scaling up to 5000 files within a year with efficient parallel processing and resource management)\n8. Integration with existing systems or third-party services (Google Cloud Speech-to-Text, Microsoft Azure Text Translation, IBM Watson, Amazon Transcribe, OpenSubtitles for subtitle alignment if needed)\n9. User interface design guidelines (user-friendly, intuitive, responsive, multi-device compatibility)\n10. Performance benchmarking and monitoring strategies to ensure system reliability and efficiency",
