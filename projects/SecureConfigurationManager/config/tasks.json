    "description": "This RFC outlines the detailed requirements for the SecureConfigurationManager system. The scope encompasses management of security configurations across an organization's IT infrastructure, including (but not limited to): network devices, servers, applications, databases, and endpoints. The system aims to enforce security policies and standards in accordance with best practices and industry regulations. Key requirements include: configuration templates, real-time monitoring, alerting, and reporting, as well as integrations with existing IT management tools. This RFC encourages feedback and suggestions for improvement. It is currently assigned to the code-architect for review and updates. Once approved, it will be passed to the task-decomposer for further decomposition.",
