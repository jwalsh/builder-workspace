    "description": "This RFC outlines the detailed requirements for the SecureConfigurationManager system. The scope encompasses management of security configurations across an organization's IT infrastructure, including network devices, servers, applications, databases, and endpoints. The system aims to enforce security policies and standards in accordance with best practices and industry regulations such as NIST SP 800-53, PCI-DSS, and GDPR. Key requirements include: configuration templates, real-time monitoring, alerting, and reporting, as well as integrations with existing IT management tools and popular compliance frameworks. This RFC encourages feedback and suggestions for improvement. It is currently assigned to the code-architect for review and updates. Once approved, it will be passed to the task-decomposer for further decomposition. A list of potential use cases and scenarios has been added to provide a more comprehensive understanding.",
