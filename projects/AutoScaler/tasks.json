    "description": "Design the overall system architecture for the AutoScaler system, including the following components: data ingestion and processing, usage pattern prediction, resource allocation and scaling, monitoring and alerting, user interface, and security. The architecture should consider data flow, integration points with cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP), scalability, fault tolerance, cost optimization, and edge cases such as high load, low resource availability, and failures in various components. Provide diagrams, documentation for the proposed architecture, including a high-level overview, detailed component diagrams, and guidelines on how to integrate with third-party APIs. Highlight any potential performance bottlenecks and propose solutions to optimize performance. The design should follow best practices for maintainability, modularity, and clean code. Since this RFC is in the REVIEW state, please provide feedback and suggest improvements as needed.",
