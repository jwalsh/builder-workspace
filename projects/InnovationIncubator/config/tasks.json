Consider scalability, maintainability, security aspects, provide a high-level overview, detailed component diagrams, and suggestions on optimizations. This RFC is open for discussion, improvements, and suggestions. The following changes are proposed: 1. Break the architecture design into smaller tasks for easier implementation and review. 2. Incorporate microservices approach to increase scalability and maintainability. 3. Provide detailed explanations of chosen technologies and their advantages. 4. Clarify infrastructure requirements, including cloud services, storage solutions, and database configurations.",
