Embrace a microservices approach to enhance scalability and maintainability. Provide detailed explanations of chosen technologies, their advantages, and the rationale behind them. Clarify infrastructure requirements, including cloud services (e.g., AWS or Google Cloud), storage solutions (e.g., S3 or Google Cloud Storage), database configurations (e.g., MySQL or MongoDB), and explain how these choices contribute to system performance, scalability, and security. This RFC is open for discussion, improvements, and suggestions. The following changes are proposed: 1. Break the architecture design into smaller tasks for easier implementation and review. 2. Incorporate microservices approach to increase scalability and maintainability. 3. Provide detailed explanations of chosen technologies and their advantages. 4. Clarify infrastructure requirements, including cloud services, storage solutions, and database configurations.",
