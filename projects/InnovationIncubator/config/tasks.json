    "description": "This RFC proposes the design of the overall system architecture for the InnovationIncubator project. The design is broken down into smaller tasks to facilitate easier implementation, with clear dependencies on 'Define Project Scope and Requirements' and 'Gather Non-Functional Requirements'. A microservices approach will be employed to increase scalability and maintainability. Open-source technologies will be primarily used for cost-effectiveness and community support. Detailed explanations of chosen technologies, their advantages, and the rationale behind them will be provided. Infrastructure requirements will be clarified in detail, including cloud services (AWS), storage solutions (S3), database configurations (MySQL), and an explanation of how these choices contribute to system performance, scalability, and security. This RFC is open for discussion, improvements, and suggestions. The following changes are proposed: 1. Break the architecture design into smaller tasks with clear dependency on 'Define Project Scope and Requirements' and 'Gather Non-Functional Requirements'. 2. Incorporate microservices approach to increase scalability and maintainability. 3. Provide detailed explanations of chosen technologies, their advantages, and the rationale behind them with a focus on open-source technologies for cost-effectiveness and community support. 4. Clarify infrastructure requirements in detail, including cloud services (AWS), storage solutions (S3), database configurations (MySQL), and explain how these choices contribute to system performance, scalability, and security. This RFC is ready for the 'APPROVAL' state once feedback and suggestions have been incorporated.",
