This includes identifying target users (individual lenders/borrowers, institutional investors, etc.), desired features (peer-to-peer lending, collateralized lending, interest rate calculation, risk assessment, etc.), regulatory compliance needs (KYC/AML, data privacy, etc.), success criteria (user adoption, loan volume, platform liquidity, etc.), and non-functional requirements (scalability, performance, security, etc.). Additionally, outline the overall system architecture, including the blockchain platform, smart contracts, and integrations with external systems (e.g., identity verification, credit scoring, payment gateways).",
