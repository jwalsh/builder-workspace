    "description": "Gather and document the requirements for the CodeSmellDetector tool. This includes specifying the types of code smells to detect (e.g., Long Method, Large Class, God Object), supporting programming languages initially (Java, Python, JavaScript), defining user roles and permissions, outlining integration with existing tools (IDEs, version control systems like Git, continuous integration systems like Jenkins or Travis CI, and code repositories like Github or Bitbucket), detailing desired reporting and visualization features such as heatmaps, trend graphs, and code snippets, providing a high-level user experience vision that includes intuitive interfaces for beginner and advanced users, and considering the potential for future extensions to support other programming languages and additional code smells. Additionally, consider the potential for mobile app version(s) and API integration.",
