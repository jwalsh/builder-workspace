    "title": "Define Project Scope and Requirements - REVISED",
    "description": "This RFC outlines the requirements for the CodeSmellDetector tool. The following scope is proposed: \n1. Supported programming languages initially will be Java, Python, JavaScript, with a roadmap to incorporate additional languages such as Go, Ruby, and PHP.\n2. Identify common code smells including Long Method, Large Class, God Object, Cyclomatic Complexity, Dead Code, but also consider less common ones like Data Clumps, Lazy Class, and Shotgun Surgery.\n3. Define user roles and permissions: developer, reviewer, admin, with the ability to assign different levels of access based on project or organization needs.\n4. Integrate with IDEs (e.g., IntelliJ, Visual Studio Code), version control systems (Git, SVN), continuous integration systems (Jenkins, Travis CI), and code repositories (Github, Bitbucket).\n5. Provide reporting and visualization features such as heatmaps, trend graphs, and code snippets for easier understanding and addressing of code smells.\n6. Design a user-friendly interface suitable for both beginner and advanced users, with a focus on making the tool accessible and easy to navigate.\n7. Consider potential future extensions to support other programming languages and additional code smells, as well as the possibility of mobile app versions and API integration.\n8. Ensure the tool adheres to security best practices and provides options for data encryption and access control.\n9. Specify performance requirements such as maximum allowed time for scanning projects or the number of projects that can be analyzed concurrently, with the goal of minimizing impact on productivity.\n10. Consider the potential for a lite version for open-source projects, to encourage its adoption and contribute to the broader developer community.\nFinally, outline the minimum viable product (MVP) and update the rfc_state field if ready for the next state.",
