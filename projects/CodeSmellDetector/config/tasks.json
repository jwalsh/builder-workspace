    "description": "Gather and document the requirements for the CodeSmellDetector tool. This includes specifying the types of code smells to detect (e.g., Long Method, Large Class, God Object, Cyclomatic Complexity, Dead Code, etc.), supporting programming languages initially (Java, Python, JavaScript), defining user roles and permissions (developer, reviewer, admin), outlining integration with existing tools (IDEs, version control systems like Git, continuous integration systems like Jenkins or Travis CI, code repositories like Github or Bitbucket), detailing desired reporting and visualization features such as heatmaps, trend graphs, and code snippets, providing a high-level user experience vision that includes intuitive interfaces for beginner and advanced users, and considering the potential for future extensions to support other programming languages and additional code smells. Additionally, consider the potential for mobile app version(s) and API integration, and outline the minimum viable product (MVP). Furthermore, ensure the tool adheres to security best practices and provides options for data encryption and access control. Finally, specify the performance requirements, such as the maximum allowed time for scanning projects or the number of projects that can be analyzed concurrently. Lastly, consider the potential for a lite version for open-source projects.",
