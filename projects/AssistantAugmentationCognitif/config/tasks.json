    "title": "Define Project Scope and Requirements - Brain-Computer Interface System",
    "description": "This task aims to clearly define the scope, objectives, and functional/non-functional requirements for the development of a brain-computer interface system designed to enhance human cognitive abilities in real-time. The definition should cover the following aspects:\n1. Functional Requirements (list specific user actions and system responses, include examples such as: user thinking 'move right' and the system translates this into a corresponding action on screen or device)\n   - Include additional examples for various actions like user imagining an object and the system displaying it in 3D, user thinking of a mathematical problem and the system solving it on-screen.\n2. Non-Functional Requirements (performance, security, scalability, usability, etc., also specify desired response times for different user actions, potential data privacy concerns, and the need for seamless integration with existing systems)\n   - Provide specific performance benchmarks, such as latency under 100 milliseconds or ability to process data from multiple sources simultaneously.\n3. Any project constraints or assumptions (for example, the system must be compatible with commonly used brain-computer interface hardware, the initial version will only support English language input)\n   - Specify that the system should be compatible with major BCI hardware brands and that future versions may support additional languages based on user feedback.\n4. Future Scope (explore potential advancements or extensions of the system in the future, such as integrating with AI models for predictive analysis, or developing a mobile app version)\n   - Discuss the benefits of these extensions and the challenges they might pose.\nThe output will provide a solid foundation for the design, implementation, testing, and documentation phases of the project. However, I would suggest adding more details on the specific technologies to be used (neuroimaging techniques, signal processing algorithms) and the user experience design considerations (ease of use, intuitive interfaces, etc.).\nPlease note that the current task is focusing on defining the requirements rather than the actual design or implementation details.\nThe RFC is ready for the next state. Please update the 'rfc_state' field to 'APPROVED_FOR_IMPLEMENTATION'.",
