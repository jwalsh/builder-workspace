    "title": "Define Project Scope and Requirements - Brain-Computer Interface System",
    "description": "This task aims to clearly define the scope, objectives, and functional/non-functional requirements for the development of a brain-computer interface system designed to enhance human cognitive abilities in real-time. The definition should cover the following aspects:\n1. Functional Requirements (list specific user actions and system responses, include examples such as: user thinking 'move right' and the system translates this into a corresponding action on screen or device)\n2. Non-Functional Requirements (performance, security, scalability, usability, etc., also specify desired response times for different user actions, potential data privacy concerns, and the need for seamless integration with existing systems)\n3. Any project constraints or assumptions (for example, the system must be compatible with commonly used brain-computer interface hardware, the initial version will only support English language input).\nThe output will provide a solid foundation for the design, implementation, testing, and documentation phases of the project.\nPlease note that the current task is focusing on defining the requirements rather than the actual design or implementation details.",
