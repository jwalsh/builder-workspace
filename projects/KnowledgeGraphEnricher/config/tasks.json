    "description": "Thoroughly investigate and document the project requirements. This involves specifying knowledge sources to be integrated (APIs, databases), desired features and functionalities, target users and use cases, as well as any constraints or limitations that should be considered during development. Additionally, identify potential data privacy and security concerns that may arise from integrating various knowledge sources, propose strategies for addressing them, and research best practices for AI-powered tools in the field of knowledge graph enrichment. The task also includes an assessment of required resources (e.g., hardware, software) and timelines. Upon completion, compile findings into a comprehensive requirements document that includes a section on AI ethics to guide further development. Also, consider conducting a SWOT analysis for project planning purposes. The task may require collaboration with team members from various disciplines such as AI, database management, security, and user experience design. Once complete, share the requirements document with the team for review and refinement. Upon final approval, update the document to serve as the project's blueprint and reference guide for development. \n\nUpon completion, update the rfc_state field to 'REVIEW'.\n\n**Suggested Changes:**\n- Clarify that the AI-powered tool will not only enrich knowledge graphs but also automatically do so.\n- Add a bullet point about the need for real-time or near real-time data processing capabilities due to the dynamic nature of knowledge graphs.",
