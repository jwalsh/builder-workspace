    "description": "Design the overall system architecture for the Local Experience Matchmaker project. The design should focus on maintainability, modularity, scalability, and performance, taking into account aspects such as user authentication and authorization, search and matching algorithms (including AI/ML integration with collaboration from our data science team), payment processing, messaging and communication, rating and review systems, scalability and load balancing, error handling and graceful degradation for edge cases, data privacy and security, and documentation of components, dataflow, and interactions between different modules. This RFC serves as a guide for the development team. Once the project scope and requirements have been defined, this task can be assigned to the code-architect or task-decomposer based on the project's needs. This RFC is now ready for the 'IN_PROGRESS' state (as it requires feedback from the team before moving forward). Please note that the AI/ML integration in search and matching algorithms may require ongoing collaboration with our data science team. The following suggestions are made: 1. Clarify the specific requirements of user authentication and authorization, including details on how different roles (e.g., traveler, local experience provider, guide) will be handled. Specify clear permissions for each role. 2. Specify more concrete expectations for the AI/ML component, such as which algorithms to use, data sources required, and expected outcomes. Provide a brief overview of the collaboration process with the data science team. 3. Include a timeline or estimated timeline for each major deliverable of the project, including milestones and deadlines. 4. Consider adding requirements for monitoring system performance and implementing A/B testing for continuous improvement. 5. Address potential issues related to cross-platform compatibility and mobile optimization. 6. Define the technology stack that will be used for the development of this project. This RFC is now ready for the 'IN_PROGRESS' state, assigned to 'code-architect'.",

However, to further clarify the scope and expectations, it would be beneficial to specify the following: \n\n1. Define the data structure for each entity (user profiles, experiences, guides, etc.) with examples. \n2. Detail how the normalization, indexing, partitioning, caching, and performance optimizations will be implemented.\n3. Specify the exact cloud-based databases to be used (e.g., AWS DynamoDB or Google Firestore).\n4. Explain the strategy for sharding based on geographical regions.\n5. Describe the security measures in more detail, including encryption at rest, access control, and data masking strategies.\n6. Discuss the implementation of server-side caching and materialized views.\n7. Provide an overview of the monitoring system to be used for tracking database usage patterns and identifying potential bottlenecks.\n\nIn addition, since the task is ready for further review and discussion, update the 'rfc_state' field: \n'rfc_state': 'READY_FOR_DISCUSSION'",
