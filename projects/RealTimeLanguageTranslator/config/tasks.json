The design should take into account scalability, performance, security, maintainability aspects, and align with the project's requirements. Provide a modular design for easier updates and maintenance, ensuring compatibility with cross-platform development methodologies. Incorporate multi-language support, real-time translation capabilities, and offline mode functionality where possible.",
