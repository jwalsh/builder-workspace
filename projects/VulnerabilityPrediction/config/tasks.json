    "description": "Detailed documentation of the project scope, objectives, and requirements for the vulnerability prediction system. This involves understanding the specific software types and their related vulnerabilities, setting achievable accuracy targets, defining performance, scalability, and security requirements, outlining necessary data sources and formats, exploring integration possibilities with existing tools or systems, specifying user interface requirements, addressing any compliance, regulatory, or specific functional constraints, considering the potential impact on system reliability and maintainability, and discussing the roles and responsibilities of each team member. Additionally, we will create a prototype to demonstrate the functionality and feasibility of the project. Upon approval of the prototype, the next step would be to move into the design and development phase.",
