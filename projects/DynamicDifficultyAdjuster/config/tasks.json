    "description": "Gather and document the functional and non-functional requirements for the DynamicDifficultyAdjuster system. The requirements should cover the following aspects:\n\n1. User management and authentication\n   - Support for multiple user roles (e.g., student, teacher, admin)\n2. Coding challenge management (creation, update, deletion)\n3. Difficulty level adjustment algorithm (include specific considerations for balancing difficulty progression with user learning curve and performance)\n   - Define a mechanism to assess the complexity of challenges\n4. User performance tracking and analysis (data structures and methods for efficient storage and retrieval of user data, as well as methods for analyzing the data to determine difficulty level changes)\n5. Reporting and analytics (methods for generating reports on user performance and system effectiveness)\n   - Include options for customizable reporting\n6. Integration with existing coding platforms or learning management systems (identify potential integration points and required APIs)\n7. Scalability and performance requirements (specifications for handling large numbers of users and challenges without significant degradation in system performance)\n8. Security and data privacy considerations (outline measures to protect user data and ensure compliance with relevant laws and regulations)\n   - Add a section on secure data storage and transmission\n9. User interface and experience requirements (UI/UX design principles, user feedback mechanisms, accessibility considerations)\n10. Deployment and maintenance requirements (deployment strategies, system monitoring and logging, backup and recovery procedures)\n   - Consider cloud deployment options for scalability",
