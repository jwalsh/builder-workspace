    "description": "Gather and document detailed requirements for the DataShield project. This includes specific data types (structured/unstructured), security policies (encryption, access controls, etc.), user roles (admin, standard, read-only), integration points with the data warehouse (SQL Server, PostgreSQL) and object storage (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage), non-functional requirements such as performance, scalability, and availability, error handling, and logging mechanisms. Additionally, consider edge cases for data types, potential future integrations, and any other relevant system constraints. Update the documentation to reflect a comprehensive understanding of the project scope. Consider incorporating functional and non-functional requirements for edge scenarios, such as handling sensitive data in transit, exceptional access control needs, and exceptionally large volumes of data. Update the documentation to account for these additional considerations. Provide initial wireframes or UX/UI design elements for the user interface, focusing on a user-friendly and intuitive design. Furthermore, address security concerns related to handling sensitive data by outlining secure communication protocols, encryption standards, and data masking techniques. Incorporate any necessary feedback from relevant team members (e.g., security specialist). Update the documentation to account for these additional considerations.",
