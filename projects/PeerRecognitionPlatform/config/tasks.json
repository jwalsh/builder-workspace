NoSQL (MongoDB) for unstructured data storage such as user comments and feedback.\n  - Add a note to consider using serverless architecture for certain backend functions where applicable, if not already considered.\n- Infrastructure: Cloud-based (AWS or GCP), containerization using Docker, orchestration with Kubernetes, managed services like RDS, ECS, and ELB, and monitoring tools like Datadog or Prometheus.\n  - Add a note to consider implementing serverless functions for certain infrastructure components where applicable.\n- Security: OAuth 2.0 for authentication, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for authorization, data encryption at rest and in transit, and compliance with industry standards such as GDPR and PCI-DSS.\n- Integration: Third-party services (email, push notifications, social media APIs) through appropriate libraries or SDKs.\n\nNotes:\n  - Ensure the frontend is SEO friendly, accessible, and built with accessibility in mind, following WCAG guidelines.\n  - Consider using a combination of serverless architecture and traditional infrastructure components where applicable.",

Also, ensure that the implemented solutions are secure and scalable to accommodate future growth. Consider integrating the platform with existing security tools and practices, implement version control strategies, and establish a system for rolling back changes in case of failures or emergencies. Update the task assignments as follows: The Task-Decomposer will break down this task into smaller manageable sub-tasks, the Project Manager will oversee progress, the Code-Architect will provide architectural guidance, Frontend/Backend Developers will implement specific aspects, Database Specialist may be consulted for database-related issues, QA Tester will test deployments, and Security Specialist will ensure security compliance. Lastly, I recommend updating the 'dependencies' field to include the assigned team members (i.e., Frontend Developer, Backend Developer) and clarify that the DevOps Engineer is responsible for initial implementation as stated in the 'assigned_to' field.",
