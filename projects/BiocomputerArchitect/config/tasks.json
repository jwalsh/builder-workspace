    "description": "Gather and document the project requirements, objectives, constraints, and success criteria for designing and simulating biocomputers using engineered cellular components for parallel processing and low-energy computation. This should include defining the desired functionality, performance targets, scalability requirements, and any specific constraints or assumptions related to the biological components and computational models. Additionally, consider the following aspects: (1) Identify the target applications or problem domains where biocomputers could provide significant advantages over traditional computing systems. (2) Determine the level of accuracy and fidelity required for simulating biological processes and interactions. (3) Establish guidelines for integrating biological data and models from various sources. (4) Define the expected outputs and visualizations for the simulations. (5) Outline the required expertise and collaboration with domain experts (e.g., biologists, computer scientists, engineers). (6) Define the evaluation criteria and metrics to assess the performance and accuracy of the simulations. (7) Identify potential risks, challenges, and mitigation strategies related to the complexity of biological systems and the integration of diverse data sources. (8) Determine the timeline for each phase of the project, including milestones and deadlines. (9) Identify any resource requirements, such as hardware, software, or personnel. (10) Define the process for handling changes or updates to the project scope during development. (11) Include a section on ethical considerations and guidelines related to the use of engineered cellular components and data privacy. (12) Consider the long-term scalability of the project and potential future improvements or extensions.",
