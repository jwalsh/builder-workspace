    "description": "This RFC outlines the comprehensive requirements for the CodeQualityGameshow platform. The scope includes gamification aspects (points system, levels, achievements), code quality rules (coding standards, best practices, common mistakes to avoid), user roles (contestants, mentors, judges), scoring system, leaderboard, challenge creation and submission process, code editor integration (support for popular IDEs such as Visual Studio Code, Atom, and Sublime Text), user authentication and authorization (OAuth 2.0 integration for social logins and Google/GitHub API for account linking), data storage and retrieval (SQL and NoSQL solutions), APIs for third-party tools integration (Linting tools, Testing frameworks), localization and accessibility features (i18n support, WCAG 2.1 compliance), performance metrics (response times, load times, error rates), a community feedback and suggestion mechanism, and other essential components. The platform's performance metrics should be specified to ensure optimal user experience. This RFC is currently in the READY_FOR_TASK_DECOMPOSITION state.",
