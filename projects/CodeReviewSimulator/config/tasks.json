Collaborate with relevant stakeholders (e.g., product owners, subject matter experts, end-users, developers) to capture a comprehensive set of requirements. This process should include creating mockups or wireframes for major features and establishing UI/UX guidelines. Additionally, consider incorporating best practices for code reviews, such as providing clear feedback, ensuring timely response, and promoting constructive discussions.",
