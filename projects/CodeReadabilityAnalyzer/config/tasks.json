    "description": "Revised requirements for the CodeReadabilityAnalyzer project: The tool will be an AI-based code assessment system that helps developers improve their code readability. It aims to serve as a resource for developers of all skill levels, including open source contributors. Supported programming languages will include Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, and others. Integrate readability metrics such as McCabe, Halstead, and Lines of Code (LOC), implement features like code suggestions, automated refactoring tools, progress tracking, and integration with IDEs/coders' text editors. The MVP will include basic readability analysis, while potential future enhancements may include additional advanced features. The tool is designed not only to assess readability but also to educate in the principles of clean code. Upon review, it is suggested that we also consider incorporating popular coding styles guides and best practices for each supported language into the system.",
