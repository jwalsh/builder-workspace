Ensure that the architecture follows best practices for scalability, maintainability, and performance. Consider the use of microservices, event-driven architecture, and serverless functions where appropriate. Outline the technology stack, including programming languages, frameworks, and libraries. Define the data models and database schemas. Identify potential third-party integrations (e.g., authentication, gamification, analytics). Address security concerns, such as data encryption, access control, and compliance with relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA). Provide a high-level overview of the deployment strategy and infrastructure requirements.",
