    "description": "Design the overall architecture of the CorporateSkillQuest platform, including frontend, backend, database, and necessary integrations. Adhere to best practices for scalability, maintainability, and performance by considering microservices, event-driven architecture, and serverless functions where appropriate. Specify the technology stack, including programming languages, frameworks, and libraries. Define data models and database schemas. Identify potential third-party integrations (e.g., authentication, gamification, analytics). Address security concerns, such as data encryption, access control, and compliance with relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA). Provide a high-level overview of the deployment strategy and infrastructure requirements. Additionally, outline the responsibilities for each team member involved in the architecture design phase and propose an iterative development process.",
