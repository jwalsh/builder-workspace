    "description": "This revised task aims to comprehensively document the detailed requirements for the CorporateSkillQuest platform. The documentation will include features, user roles (learner, instructor, admin), gamification elements (points system, leaderboards, rewards), integration with existing Learning Management Systems (LMS) such as Blackboard and Canvas, data models (User, Skill, Course, Challenge, Reward), security considerations (user authentication, role-based access control, data privacy, including GDPR compliance for global deployments), scalability requirements (handling large user bases, global deployments with multi-region support), performance expectations (response times, system stability during peak usage, including SLAs), non-functional requirements (usability, accessibility, localization), edge cases, error handling, and exceptional scenarios. The document will also address API design for potential third-party integrations. Upon completion, this document will serve as a guiding blueprint for the development process.",

    "description": "Design the overall architecture of the CorporateSkillQuest platform, including frontend, backend, database, and necessary integrations. Adhere to best practices for scalability, maintainability, and performance by considering microservices, event-driven architecture, and serverless functions where appropriate. Utilize React/Redux (frontend), Node.js (backend) with Express.js as a framework, PostgreSQL (database), AWS Lambda (serverless functions). Define data models and database schemas, with potential third-party integrations such as authentication using OAuth, gamification through BadgeOS, analytics using Google Analytics, and security features including data encryption, access control, and compliance with GDPR, CCPA regulations. Provide a high-level overview of the deployment strategy and infrastructure requirements like AWS EC2 instances, RDS, and Elasticache. Assign responsibilities for each team member involved in the architecture design phase, proposing an iterative development process such as Scrum or Kanban methodology. Suggest unit testing, integration testing, and system testing for ensuring quality. In the RFC_STATE field, update to 'APPROVED FOR DECOMPOSITION' as this task is ready for decomposition into smaller tasks, but requires further review and discussion among team members.",
