    "description": "Design the overall architecture of the DistributedLogAnalyzer system, including components, data flow, communication protocols (such as gRPC for high-performance inter-service communication and HTTPS for client-server interactions), scalability considerations (auto-scaling strategies using Kubernetes or similar tools), security measures (incorporate encryption and authentication mechanisms for log transmission and storage using TLS/SSL and OAuth2, respectively), fault tolerance mechanisms (such as redundancy through data replication and failover strategies like active-active clusters), and a modular design to facilitate future enhancements. Also, specify the tech stack for each component: for example, using Python/Django for backend services, React/Redux for frontend, and Elasticsearch for log storage and analysis. Additionally, consider implementing a logging system (such as Log4j or Logback) for internal system logs.",
