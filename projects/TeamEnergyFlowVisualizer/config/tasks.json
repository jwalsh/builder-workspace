    "description": "Gather and document the detailed requirements for the TeamEnergyFlowVisualizer project. The requirements should include the following: data sources (user activities logs, project management tools, feedback surveys), visualization types (line charts, bar graphs, heatmaps, gauge meters), user interactions (filtering, sorting, drill-downs, alerts), performance metrics (task completion rates, team morale indicators, workflow efficiency, and potential metrics such as number of completed tasks per day, average response time to feedback, and number of resolved issues per day), non-functional requirements such as security (data encryption, user access controls), scalability (handling large datasets, maintaining performance under load), maintainability (code modularity, documentation standards), usability (user-friendly interface, accessible design), reliability (error handling, system resilience) and compliance (GDPR, HIPAA if applicable). Review and update the list of requirements based on current best practices, team feedback, and latest industry trends. Once complete, present to the team for review and refinement. In addition, consider conducting a competitive analysis to ensure our product stands out in the market. Update the task to include this step and assign it to the appropriate team member (market-researcher). If needed, collaborate with other teams for data integration and synchronization. Once complete, update the rfc_state to 'REVIEW'.",
