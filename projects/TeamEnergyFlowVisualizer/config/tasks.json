    "description": "Gather and document the detailed requirements for the TeamEnergyFlowVisualizer project. The requirements should include data sources (user activities logs, project management tools, feedback surveys), visualization types (line charts, bar graphs, heatmaps, gauge meters), user interactions (filtering, sorting, drill-downs, alerts), performance metrics (task completion rates, team morale indicators, workflow efficiency, number of completed tasks per day, average response time to feedback, and number of resolved issues per day), non-functional requirements such as security (data encryption, user access controls), scalability (handling large datasets, maintaining performance under load), maintainability (code modularity, documentation standards), usability (user-friendly interface, accessible design), reliability (error handling, system resilience) and compliance (GDPR, HIPAA if applicable). Review and update the list of requirements based on current best practices, team feedback, and latest industry trends. Conduct a competitive analysis to ensure our product stands out in the market. Update the task to include this step and assign it to the appropriate team member (market-researcher). If needed, collaborate with other teams for data integration and synchronization. Once complete, present to the team for review and refinement. In addition, consider conducting a usability testing phase before final implementation. Update the task to include this recommendation and assign it to the appropriate team member (usability-tester). Once all steps are completed, update the rfc_state to 'REVIEW'. Also, I recommend adding 'user-centric design' under usability requirements, to ensure that the dashboard is tailored to individual user preferences. Finally, consider integrating real-time analytics and machine learning algorithms for predictive analysis and dynamic adaptability of the visualization. Update the task accordingly.",
