    "description": "This RFC aims to revise the project requirements for our blockchain-based supply chain tracking system. The updates will focus on a comprehensive analysis of data privacy and security measures, scalability considerations, performance metrics, user interface design, smart contract integration, compliance with regulations and industry standards. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and success criteria will be clearly defined. To improve accessibility and understanding, the document will use clear terminology that all stakeholders can easily comprehend. Upon completion, the revised requirements document will be shared for feedback and iterated as needed. If approved, this RFC will progress to the next state.",
