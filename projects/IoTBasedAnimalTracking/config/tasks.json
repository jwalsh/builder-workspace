    "description": "This RFC outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for the IoT-based animal tracking system, including system architecture, hardware specifications, software components, data storage solutions, user interface design, security measures, performance benchmarks, scalability considerations, guidelines for testing and documentation. The revised version includes more specific details about the system's data processing capabilities (e.g., real-time vs batch processing), clarifies the types of animals that the system will track (e.g., wild animals such as elephants, tigers, or domestic animals like cows and sheep), specifies any environmental conditions or terrains that the tracking devices should be able to withstand (e.g., waterproof, dust-resistant, capable of operating in extreme temperatures).",
