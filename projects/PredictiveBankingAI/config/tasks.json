Leverage cloud-based solutions (e.g., AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud) for cost efficiency, scalability, and flexibility. The database design should take into account the needs of various system components such as AI models and personalized financial advice algorithms. Collaborate with the Data Modeling and Requirements Analysis team to finalize the data model. Consider using a managed service like Amazon Redshift or Google BigQuery for the data warehouse, and MongoDB Atlas or Azure Cosmos DB for the operational database for improved flexibility and scalability. Ensure that the design supports horizontal scaling for handling large volumes of data and provides high availability to maintain system reliability. Also, consider using encryption at rest and in transit to further secure sensitive user data. Lastly, ensure that the design is compatible with big data processing frameworks like Apache Spark or Presto for advanced analytics.
