    "description": "Design the overall system architecture, including the frontend, backend, and database components, as well as the integration between them. Consider the following aspects:\n\n- Frontend: Decide on the technology stack (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js) and the architecture pattern (e.g., component-based, flux/redux). Ensure responsiveness, accessibility, and a smooth user experience.\n\n- Backend: Choose the server-side language and framework (e.g., Node.js with Express, Python with Django/Flask, Ruby on Rails). Define the API structure, data models, and business logic.\n\n- Database: Select the appropriate database system (e.g., SQL, NoSQL) based on the data requirements, scalability needs, and query patterns. Consider data modeling, schema design, and data access patterns.\n\n- Integration: Define the communication protocols and data formats for the frontend-backend integration (e.g., REST API, GraphQL). Ensure secure and efficient data transfer.\n\n- Authentication and Authorization: Implement secure user authentication (e.g., JWT, OAuth) and role-based access control (RBAC) for authorization.\n\n- Scalability and Performance: Ensure the architecture can handle increasing user traffic and data volume. Consider caching, load balancing, and horizontal scaling strategies.\n\n- Monitoring and Logging: Incorporate monitoring and logging solutions (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack) for debugging, performance analysis, and error tracking.\n\n- DevOps and Deployment: Define the deployment strategy (e.g., containerization, serverless) and infrastructure setup (e.g., cloud, on-premises).\n\n- Security: Implement security best practices, such as input validation, data encryption, and secure communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS).",
