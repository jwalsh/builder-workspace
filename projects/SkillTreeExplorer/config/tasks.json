    "description": "Design the overall system architecture for SkillTreeExplorer platform. Key aspects to consider include:\n\n- Frontend: Adopt a modern technology stack like React or Vue.js and employ a component-based architecture with Flux/Redux or a similar state management pattern (consider using Redux Toolkit which is an updated version of Redux). Ensure responsiveness, accessibility, and a seamless user experience. For better modularity, consider using module bundlers like Webpack or Parcel.\n\n- Backend: Opt for either Node.js with Express, Python with Django/Flask, or Ruby on Rails as the server-side language and framework. Plan the API structure, data models, and business logic accordingly. Consider microservices architecture for better scalability and maintainability (consider using Kubernetes for managing microservices).\n\n- Database: Select an appropriate database system (either SQL or NoSQL) based on the specific data requirements, scalability needs, and query patterns. PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and DynamoDB are some options to consider (consider using PostgreSQL for its robustness and support for complex queries).\n\n- Integration: Implement a secure and efficient frontend-backend integration through either REST API or GraphQL.\n\n- Authentication and Authorization: Implement secure user authentication using JWT and role-based access control (RBAC) for authorization. Consider OAuth 2.0 for external third-party integrations, but keep in mind that it may introduce additional complexity.\n\n- Scalability and Performance: Design the architecture to handle increasing user traffic and data volume by implementing caching, load balancing, and horizontal scaling strategies (consider using a distributed cache like Redis or Memcached). Auto-scaling groups and Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) can help achieve this.\n\n- Monitoring and Logging: Incorporate monitoring and logging solutions such as Prometheus, Grafana, or ELK Stack for debugging, performance analysis, and error tracking. Additionally, consider using Sentry for exception handling and reporting.\n\n- DevOps and Deployment: Define the deployment strategy (e.g., containerization using Docker, serverless with AWS Lambda) and infrastructure setup (e.g., cloud, on-premises). Adopt a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for streamlined development and testing (consider using Jenkins or GitLab CI/CD).\n\n- Security: Implement security best practices such as input validation, data encryption, and secure communication protocols like HTTPS. Ensure compliance with industry standards like OWASP Top 10. Perform regular penetration testing to identify and fix vulnerabilities.\n\n- Documentation: Create clear and concise technical documentation to help future developers navigate the codebase (consider using Doxygen or Sphinx for documentation generation).",
