    "description": "Design the overall system architecture for SkillTreeExplorer platform. Key aspects to consider include:\n\n- Frontend: Adopt a modern technology stack like React or Vue.js and employ a component-based architecture with Flux/Redux or a similar state management pattern. Ensure responsiveness, accessibility, and a seamless user experience.\n\n- Backend: Opt for either Node.js with Express, Python with Django/Flask, or Ruby on Rails as the server-side language and framework. Plan the API structure, data models, and business logic accordingly.\n\n- Database: Select an appropriate database system (either SQL or NoSQL) based on the specific data requirements, scalability needs, and query patterns.\n\n- Integration: Implement a secure and efficient frontend-backend integration through either REST API or GraphQL.\n\n- Authentication and Authorization: Implement secure user authentication using JWT and role-based access control (RBAC) for authorization.\n\n- Scalability and Performance: Design the architecture to handle increasing user traffic and data volume by implementing caching, load balancing, and horizontal scaling strategies.\n\n- Monitoring and Logging: Incorporate monitoring and logging solutions such as Prometheus, Grafana, or ELK Stack for debugging, performance analysis, and error tracking.\n\n- DevOps and Deployment: Define the deployment strategy (e.g., containerization, serverless) and infrastructure setup (e.g., cloud, on-premises).\n\n- Security: Implement security best practices such as input validation, data encryption, and secure communication protocols like HTTPS.\n\nThis RFC is now ready for the next state. I recommend updating the rfc_state field to 'APPROVED' once discussed with the team.",
