The architecture should consider scalability, maintainability, and performance. Identify potential data sources and APIs for socioeconomic and educational data (considering open datasets and partnerships with relevant institutions). Define the core prediction algorithms and machine learning models to be used (explain choice of specific models and their relevance to the problem). Outline the user interface and experience flow, including wireframes or mockups where possible. Provide a detailed technical plan for data processing pipelines, focusing on data privacy and security considerations.",
