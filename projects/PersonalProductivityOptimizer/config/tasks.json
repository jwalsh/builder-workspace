    "description": "This RFC proposes the design of the user interface and user experience for the PersonalProductivityOptimizer application. The proposed design will focus on the following aspects: 1) Intuitive and user-friendly layout, 2) Responsive design for various devices, 3) Accessibility features for users with disabilities, 4) Integration with the application's core functionality, 5) Consistent branding and visual identity. Additionally, I recommend the following improvements: 6) Incorporate feedback from user research and requirements gathering, 7) Include interactive prototypes for better understanding of the proposed design, 8) Consider implementing adaptive UI to accommodate different user preferences and devices, 9) Provide clear instructions and tooltips for less tech-savvy users. To ensure a seamless workflow, I suggest the following dependency adjustments: Dependencies [ System Architecture Design, User Research and Requirements Gathering, Design System Development (for consistent branding and visual identity) ] Also, please note that this RFC requires the review of a UX/UI expert for further improvements. Upon approval, the rfc_state field can be updated to 'APPROVED'.",
