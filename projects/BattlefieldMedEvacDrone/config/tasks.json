    "description": "Define the project scope, objectives, and requirements for the BattlefieldMedEvacDrone system. Engage with various stakeholders, including military personnel, medical professionals, drone experts, and relevant government agencies. Conduct thorough research on existing medical evacuation systems, applicable regulations, and potential challenges in battlefield environments. Identify key functional and non-functional requirements, such as drone speed (>150 mph), payload capacity (minimum 350 lbs), communication protocols (encrypted and secure), security measures (drone should be resistant to hacking and GPS spoofing), environmental resilience (able to operate in extreme temperatures and terrain), compliance with military and aviation standards, and user interface design for easy operation by military personnel. Develop a comprehensive project plan, including timelines, resource allocation, risk mitigation strategies, a thorough testing and validation plan, as well as a deployment and maintenance strategy. This task involves the initial decomposition of the project into smaller, manageable tasks for further development. Ensure that the user manual is included in the documentation for easy understanding by users. In addition, conduct a SWOT analysis to identify potential strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats related to the project. The updated description will also include the need for developing secure protocols to protect patient data during transit, and the task will consider the integration of AI-based decision making systems to optimize drone routes and prioritize evacuation based on real-time battlefield data. Update the rfc_state field to 'DECOMPOSITION_IN_PROGRESS' as this RFC is ready for the next state.",
