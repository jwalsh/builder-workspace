    "description": "Define the project scope, objectives, and requirements for the BattlefieldMedEvacDrone system. Engage with various stakeholders, including military personnel, medical professionals, drone experts, and relevant government agencies. Conduct thorough research on existing medical evacuation systems, applicable regulations, and potential challenges in battlefield environments. Identify key functional and non-functional requirements, such as drone speed, payload capacity, communication protocols, security measures, environmental resilience, compliance with military and aviation standards, and user interface design for easy operation by military personnel. Develop a comprehensive project plan, including timelines, resource allocation, risk mitigation strategies, a thorough testing and validation plan, as well as a deployment and maintenance strategy. This task involves the initial decomposition of the project into smaller, manageable tasks for further development. Ensure that the user manual is included in the documentation for easy understanding by users.",
