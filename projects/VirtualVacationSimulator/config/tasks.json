The architecture should consider scalability, performance, security, maintainability, accessibility, and usability. Provide a detailed design document that includes diagrams, use cases, and performance benchmarks. Also, outline the proposed tech stack and its rationale, focusing on industry-standard solutions and open-source libraries where appropriate. Additionally, emphasize on cross-platform compatibility and ensure the system is easily extensible for future features. Consider incorporating feedback from 'Project Planning and Requirements Gathering' phase. If possible, provide an initial roadmap for the implementation process.",
