    "description": "Gather and document all functional and non-functional requirements for the IdeaAnonymizer system. This should include, but not limited to: user interface design (ensure intuitive and secure experience), data privacy regulations (compliance with GDPR, CCPA, etc.), security considerations (including anonymity preservation, authentication using OAuth 2.0, encryption of submitted ideas, and regular vulnerability assessments), stakeholder expectations (clarity on submission, review, and approval process), integration with existing systems (Slack, Jira, Google Workspace), scalability requirements (ability to handle large volumes of submissions with minimal degradation in performance), performance benchmarks (response times, throughput, etc.), and documentation of any specific technical and business needs for the project. Additionally, consider incorporating feedback mechanisms for both submitters and management to enhance the system's usability and effectiveness.",
