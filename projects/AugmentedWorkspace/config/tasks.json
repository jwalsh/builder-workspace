    "description": "Gather and document the comprehensive requirements for the AugmentedWorkspace project. Identify key stakeholders, conduct interviews or workshops to capture their needs, expectations, and pain points. Ensure all desired features are listed, along with target platforms (e.g., iOS, Android, VR/AR headsets), user personas, technical constraints, non-functional requirements such as performance, scalability, security, accessibility, usability, maintainability, and testability. The final document will serve as the basis for further project planning and development. In addition, consider potential integration with other systems or APIs, outline any necessary research or experimentation that may be required to support the project's objectives, and provide a detailed plan for integrating user feedback throughout the development process. Also, consider the long-term maintenance and evolution of the system, including strategies for updates and feature enhancements. The document will be updated regularly as new insights and requirements emerge. In case any dependencies arise during the research phase, they should be promptly added to this task.",
