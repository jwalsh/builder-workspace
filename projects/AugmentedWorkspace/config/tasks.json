    "description": "Revise the description to emphasize the need for a clear, concise, and comprehensive list of project requirements. This includes identifying key stakeholders, understanding their needs, expectations, and pain points. The list should include all desired features, target platforms (e.g., iOS, Android, VR/AR headsets), user personas, technical constraints, non-functional requirements such as performance, scalability, security, accessibility, usability, maintainability, and testability. The document will serve as the basis for further project planning and development. Potential integration with other systems or APIs should be noted, along with any necessary research or experimentation that may be required to support the project's objectives. A detailed plan for integrating user feedback throughout the development process is essential, including strategies for long-term maintenance and evolution of the system. The document will be updated regularly as new insights and requirements emerge. If any dependencies arise during the research phase, they should be promptly added to this task or related tasks. To ensure a thorough review, the document will be shared with all relevant team members (task-decomposer, project-manager, code-architect, frontend-developer, backend-developer, database-specialist, devops-engineer, qa-tester, security-specialist, technical-writer) for feedback before finalizing. Once approved, the document will be used as a reference for the next steps in the project planning and development process. Update the rfc_state field to 'REVIEW' once shared with team members.",
