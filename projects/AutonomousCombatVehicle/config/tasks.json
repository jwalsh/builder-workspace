    "description": "Update the detailed requirements for the autonomous combat vehicle, incorporating functional, non-functional, performance, legal, ethical, and safety considerations. Ensure compliance with relevant laws, regulations, and industry standards. Involve subject matter experts (SMEs), military personnel, relevant stakeholders, and a multidisciplinary team consisting of backend developers, frontend developers, security specialists, database specialists, DevOps engineers, QA testers, and technical writers in the requirements gathering process. The focus should be on developing a scalable, reliable, secure, user-friendly, maintainable solution, considering potential future updates and advancements in technology. Additionally, prioritize clarity and conciseness in all requirements documentation to ensure efficient communication within the team. Upon completion of this task, prepare a comprehensive document summarizing the requirements for further review and approval by the project manager.",
