    "description": "Revise the detailed requirements for the autonomous combat vehicle, ensuring incorporation of functional, non-functional, performance, legal, ethical, and safety considerations. Compliance with relevant laws, regulations, and industry standards is essential. Engage subject matter experts (SMEs), military personnel, relevant stakeholders, and a multidisciplinary team consisting of backend developers, frontend developers, security specialists, database specialists, DevOps engineers, QA testers, and technical writers in the requirements gathering process. The goal should be to develop a scalable, reliable, secure, user-friendly, maintainable solution, taking into account potential future updates and advancements in technology. Prioritize clarity and conciseness in all requirements documentation for efficient team communication. Upon task completion, prepare a comprehensive document summarizing the requirements for further review and approval by the project manager. Additionally, consider integrating AI ethics guidelines (e.g., Asilomar AI Principles) into the design of the autonomous combat vehicle.",
