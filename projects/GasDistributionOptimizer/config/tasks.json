The design should consider data volume, velocity, and variety, as well as scalability, fault tolerance, and data security requirements. Additionally, explore data compression techniques to minimize storage costs and optimize performance, and investigate stream processing solutions for handling real-time data streams effectively. This task will also involve researching and implementing efficient data formats for machine learning models.",
