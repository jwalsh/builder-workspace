    "description": "Design the overall system architecture for the AsyncToSyncConverter tool, including the core components, data flow, integration points with other systems, and considerations for scalability, fault tolerance, performance, security, and maintainability. The architecture should support the following key features:\n\n1. Asynchronous workflow analysis: Ability to analyze existing asynchronous workflows and identify potential synchronization points.\n2. Synchronization strategy definition: Provide a mechanism to define synchronization strategies based on the identified synchronization points, allowing for flexible configuration options.\n3. Workflow transformation: Transform the asynchronous workflow into a synchronous one based on the defined synchronization strategy, ensuring minimal loss of performance and maintaining asynchronous execution where necessary.\n4. Monitoring and logging: Implement robust monitoring and logging mechanisms to track the transformation process, identify potential issues, and support troubleshooting and diagnostic tasks.\n5. Integration with existing systems: Ensure seamless integration with existing systems and workflows to minimize disruption while maximizing compatibility and interoperability.\n6. Scalability and performance: Design the architecture to handle large-scale workflows by utilizing appropriate data structures, concurrent processing, and load balancing techniques where necessary.\n7. Security and access control: Implement appropriate security measures such as authentication, authorization, encryption, and access control mechanisms to protect sensitive data and workflows, following industry best practices.\n\nIn addition, consider edge cases, error handling, and performance optimizations to ensure the tool is robust, reliable, and efficient. Some suggestions for improvements:\n- Clarify the definition of 'minimal loss of performance' in point 3.\n- Add more details on the logging and monitoring mechanisms to be implemented.\n- Provide examples or use cases of how the tool can be integrated with existing systems.\n\nIf the RFC is ready for the next state, update the rfc_state field accordingly.",
