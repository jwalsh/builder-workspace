Define the high-level components, their responsibilities, and interactions. Provide guidelines for technology stack, coding standards, best practices, edge cases, error handling, and performance optimizations. Include considerations for accessibility and localization where applicable. After completion, conduct a code review to ensure adherence to standards, considering the use of tools like static analysis and unit testing. Update documentation as necessary. Once ready, schedule a meeting with relevant stakeholders (including project-manager, frontend-developer, backend-developer, database-specialist, devops-engineer, security-specialist, and technical-writer) for discussion and approval. If any dependencies arise during the design process, update the 'dependencies' field accordingly. If the design is complete, update the 'rfc_state' field to 'READY_FOR_REVIEW'. Consider adding a section for potential future improvements or additional features.",

Deploy to a staging environment for testing (use tools like AWS CodePipeline, GitHub Actions, or CircleCI)\n5. Deploy to production after successful testing (define clear deployment strategies such as blue-green or canary deployments)\n6. Monitoring and logging for the application in production (utilize tools like Sentry, Datadog, or New Relic)\n7. Implement monitoring and alerting mechanisms to notify the team of any issues, failures, or performance degradations (provide examples of threshold settings for alerts)\n8. In case of deployment failures, ensure automated rollback mechanisms are in place (explain how these work)\n9. Follow security best practices such as vulnerability scanning, code signing, and secure connections during deployment (specify tools like Snyk or Veracode for vulnerability scanning, and provide guidelines for securing connections)\n10. Document the CI/CD process for future reference.",
