This includes AI components (such as machine learning models for ethical dilemma recognition and decision-making), simulation engine, user interface, data storage (considering scalability, performance, security, and maintainability requirements), and integration points. Define high-level components, their responsibilities, and interactions. Provide guidelines for technology stack, coding standards, best practices, edge cases, error handling, and performance optimizations. Incorporate accessibility and localization considerations where applicable. Conduct a code review to ensure adherence to standards using tools like static analysis and unit testing. Once complete, schedule a meeting with relevant stakeholders (including project-manager, frontend-developer, backend-developer, database-specialist, devops-engineer, security-specialist, and technical-writer) for discussion and approval. If dependencies arise during the design process, update the 'dependencies' field accordingly. If the design is complete, update the 'rfc_state' field to 'READY_FOR_REVIEW'. Consider adding a section for potential future improvements or additional features. After review, assign the task to the appropriate team member for implementation.",

Additionally, consider integrating the storage system with existing infrastructure and services (e.g., authentication, logging) for seamless operation. To enhance the RFC's clarity and completeness, include specific details about the proposed data structures (e.g., tables, schemas), performance expectations (e.g., read/write operations per second, latency), and any potential challenges or limitations (e.g., data volume growth). Furthermore, provide a high-level implementation roadmap and timeline (including milestones and key deliverables), outline the necessary testing and validation steps (e.g., unit tests, integration tests, security audits), and specify the resources required for each phase of development. Additionally, consider incorporating feedback from the designated security specialist to ensure data protection standards are met. If necessary, revise the task dependencies to account for the revised scope. Finally, update the rfc_state field to 'READY_FOR_IMPLEMENTATION' when all required information is provided.",

Deploy to a staging environment for testing (use tools like AWS CodePipeline, GitHub Actions, or CircleCI)\n5. Deploy to production after successful testing (define clear deployment strategies such as blue-green or canary deployments)\n6. Monitoring and logging for the application in production (utilize tools like Sentry, Datadog, or New Relic)\n7. Implement monitoring and alerting mechanisms to notify the team of any issues, failures, or performance degradations (provide examples of threshold settings for alerts)\n8. In case of deployment failures, ensure automated rollback mechanisms are in place (explain how these work)\n9. Follow security best practices such as vulnerability scanning, code signing, and secure connections during deployment (specify tools like Snyk or Veracode for vulnerability scanning, and provide guidelines for securing connections)\n10. Document the CI/CD process for future reference.",
