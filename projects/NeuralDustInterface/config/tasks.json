    "title": "Define Project Scope and Requirements - RFC UPDATE",
    "description": "This updated RFC provides a more comprehensive approach to gathering and documenting the detailed functional and non-functional requirements for the NeuralDustInterface system. Key areas of focus include but are not limited to: specific functionality, performance metrics, interface design considerations, data privacy and security concerns, ethical guidelines, use cases, potential integration points with existing systems, and a clear definition of the system's objectives, limitations, and implications. Collaboration with subject matter experts, potential users, and relevant stakeholders will ensure a thorough understanding of the requirements. Detailed documentation for each requirement will facilitate efficient development and testing. A feasibility study has been suggested to assess the technical viability of the project. The updated task status remains 'READY_FOR_APPROVAL'.",
