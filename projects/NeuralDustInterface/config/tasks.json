    "title": "Define Project Scope and Requirements - RFC UPDATE",
    "description": "This updated RFC provides a comprehensive approach to gathering and documenting the detailed functional and non-functional requirements for the NeuralDustInterface system. Key areas of focus include but are not limited to: specific functionality, performance metrics, interface design considerations, data privacy and security concerns, ethical guidelines, use cases, potential integration points with existing systems, clear definition of the system's objectives, limitations, and implications. Collaboration with subject matter experts, potential users, and relevant stakeholders will ensure a thorough understanding of the requirements. Detailed documentation for each requirement will facilitate efficient development and testing. A feasibility study has been suggested to assess the technical viability of the project. The updated task status remains 'READY_FOR_APPROVAL'. To further improve the RFC, I suggest adding a section on potential challenges or risks that may arise during the development and implementation of this system. This will help the team to be proactive in addressing any issues that may come up. I recommend assigning this task to the project-manager for further refinement.",
