    "description": "Define project scope, objectives, and requirements for the AI-powered weather forecasting system. Collaborate with a diverse team of stakeholders, including meteorologists, energy providers, end-users, and domain experts to gather insights and perspectives. Conduct comprehensive market research, analyze existing weather forecasting models, techniques, and datasets. Identify key performance indicators (KPIs), success criteria, and potential risks for the project. Develop a detailed project plan, including timelines, resource allocation, and a communication strategy that emphasizes transparency and collaboration. Integrate agile methodologies to adapt to project needs and ensure continuous improvement. Break down this task into sub-tasks with clear deliverables for each team member. Once completed, share the plan and progress regularly with all stakeholders. To improve clarity, consider adding specific milestones and deadlines in the project timeline. Update the project description to include a brief mention of the AI system's role in optimizing renewable energy production and distribution. Finally, assign this task to the Project Manager for further execution.",
