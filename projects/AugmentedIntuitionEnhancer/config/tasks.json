Collaborate with team members in Project Planning and Requirements Gathering, User Experience and Interface Design, and Legal and Regulatory Compliance Review to ensure alignment of technical specifications with project goals. Break down the task into smaller sub-tasks, prioritize them based on dependencies and resource availability, provide regular updates on progress, and maintain a clear and concise documentation of the design decisions and rationale. Once the detailed specifications are complete, review with the assigned team members for feedback and iterate as necessary before finalizing.",

    "description": "Implement robust, comprehensive security and privacy measures to protect user data and ensure the device's integrity. This includes but is not limited to: end-to-end encryption for all data transmitted and stored, secure communication protocols such as TLS 1.3, access controls based on least privilege principle, multi-factor authentication, robust user authentication mechanisms, clear and concise privacy policies, regular security audits, compliance with relevant regulations and industry standards such as GDPR, HIPAA, NIST guidelines, and integration of security best practices like Zero Trust Architecture for enhanced security. The task also includes a comprehensive threat model and risk assessment to identify potential vulnerabilities and mitigation strategies. Additionally, consider implementing an opt-in/opt-out feature for data collection and usage to further enhance user privacy. To improve the task, I suggest adding a section on incident response plan and regular training for security team members. Lastly, ensure that the implemented measures are thoroughly documented in detail for future reference and updated as necessary. Update the documentation regularly to reflect any changes or improvements made. Upon completion, perform a final security audit and penetration testing to verify the effectiveness of the implemented measures. Once all checks are passed, update the rfc_state field to 'IMPLEMENTING'.",
