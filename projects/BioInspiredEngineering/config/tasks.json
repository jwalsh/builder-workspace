The revised design includes a detailed breakdown of frontend, backend, database, and necessary integrations or third-party services. Emphasis has been placed on modularity, scalability, performance optimization, security, maintainability, and extensibility. Comprehensive documentation, diagrams, and a component interaction diagram have been provided to facilitate implementation and future enhancements. Edge cases, error handling, potential performance bottlenecks, and accessibility standards for the frontend and other components as required have been addressed. The design adheres to relevant accessibility standards. Additional improvements include more robust testing strategies, improved documentation of edge cases, and consideration of future upgrades and updates.",
