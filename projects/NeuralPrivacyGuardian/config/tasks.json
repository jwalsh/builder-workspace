    "description": "Gather and document comprehensive project requirements for the NeuralPrivacyGuardian. This includes defining device specifications, identifying user needs, outlining privacy regulations, and considering potential integrations or compatibility requirements. It's crucial to involve cross-functional teams (e.g., security specialists, frontend/backend developers) in this process for a comprehensive understanding of the project scope. To ensure a thorough analysis, consider adding sections for potential scalability needs, performance benchmarks, and long-term maintainability.\n\nAlso, please add a section for risk assessment and mitigation strategies related to data privacy and security.",
