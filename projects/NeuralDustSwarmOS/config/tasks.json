    "description": "Based on the approved RFC, refine the system architecture design of the NeuralDustSwarmOS. This includes defining detailed specifications for the components, communication protocols, interfaces, and security measures. Prioritize scalability, fault tolerance, real-time performance requirements, memory efficiency, low power consumption, and extendable nature to accommodate future advancements in brain-computer interface technology. The architecture should also include provisions for monitoring and managing the system's health, ensuring continuous operation even under adverse conditions. In addition, consider the following: 1. Implement modularity to facilitate ease of upgrades and maintenance. 2. Define clear APIs for seamless integration with other systems or devices. 3. Ensure that the architecture supports multi-threading for efficient handling of multiple neural dust particles simultaneously. 4. Implement a logging system for debugging and troubleshooting purposes. 5. Consider using containerization technologies for improved isolation, scalability, and deployability. 6. Document the architecture design thoroughly to facilitate understanding and collaboration among team members. 7. Include provisions for handling and processing real-time data streams from neural dust particles for immediate feedback in brain-computer interface applications. 8. Consider integrating machine learning algorithms for intelligent analysis of the data streams. 9. Provide a modular design that allows for easy integration with existing brain-computer interface technologies. Update the architecture to support these additional requirements and suggestions.",

The revised design should encompass interaction and control protocols, error handling, performance optimization, scalability, maintainability, modularity, and edge cases. Address data privacy concerns, user experience considerations, real-time processing challenges, latency issues, and integration potential with existing BCI systems if applicable. Provide a detailed plan for implementation, including milestones and a timeline, focusing on data privacy, user experience, performance optimization, scalability, maintainability, error handling, modularity, security measures, industry standards, best practices, and integration with existing BCI systems. Consider real-time processing challenges and latency issues in the design. This task should also address the need for documentation, testing, and validation processes to ensure the quality of the BCI. Once revised, assign to task-decomposer or project-manager for further refinement and decomposition. If possible, provide a high-level architecture diagram illustrating the proposed solution.",

The framework should incorporate rigorous cross-functional testing strategies to ensure robustness, scalability, and adaptability of the operating system. To achieve this, consider employing automated testing methodologies where possible, and leverage existing tools like PyTest or Jest for unit testing, Selenium for integration testing, and GROMACS for molecular dynamics simulations. Additionally, outline a clear testing roadmap to cover various use cases and edge cases. The focus should be on both functionality and performance, ensuring the system can handle varying particle counts and brain scenarios. To streamline collaboration, make sure the framework is easily extensible, adaptable, and comes with thorough documentation.",
