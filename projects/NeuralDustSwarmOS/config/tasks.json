The revised design should encompass interaction and control protocols, error handling, performance optimization, scalability, maintainability, modularity, and edge cases, while ensuring compliance with industry standards and best practices. Address data privacy concerns, user experience considerations, and integration potential with existing BCI systems if applicable. Consider real-time processing challenges and latency issues in the design. Provide a detailed plan for implementation, including milestones and a timeline, focusing on data privacy, user experience, performance optimization, scalability, maintainability, error handling, modularity, security measures, industry standards, best practices, and integration with existing BCI systems.

The framework should incorporate rigorous cross-functional testing strategies to ensure robustness, scalability, and adaptability of the operating system. To achieve this, consider employing automated testing methodologies where possible, and leverage existing tools like PyTest or Jest for unit testing, Selenium for integration testing, and GROMACS for molecular dynamics simulations. Additionally, outline a clear testing roadmap to cover various use cases and edge cases. The focus should be on both functionality and performance, ensuring the system can handle varying particle counts and brain scenarios. To streamline collaboration, make sure the framework is easily extensible, adaptable, and comes with thorough documentation.",
