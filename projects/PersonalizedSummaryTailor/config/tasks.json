    "description": "Update the functional and non-functional requirements for the PersonalizedSummaryTailor system. The updated requirements should include user roles (Editor, Researcher, Manager, etc.), input formats (DOCX, PDF, TXT), output formats (HTML, plain text), performance expectations (summarize a 1000-word document in under 5 seconds), security/privacy considerations (data encryption, anonymization, user consent management), potential integrations with existing systems (Google Docs, Microsoft Word), edge cases (multiple roles for a user, inconsistent data formats), and error handling mechanisms. Considering the complexity of the project, it would be beneficial to break down the tasks into smaller, manageable pieces.",
