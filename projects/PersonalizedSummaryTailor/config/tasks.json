    "description": "Revised functional and non-functional requirements for the PersonalizedSummaryTailor system. The updated requirements include user roles (Editor, Researcher, Manager, etc.), input formats (DOCX, PDF, TXT), output formats (HTML, plain text), performance expectations (summarize a 1000-word document in under 5 seconds), security/privacy considerations (data encryption, anonymization, user consent management), potential integrations with existing systems (Google Docs, Microsoft Word), edge cases (multiple roles for a user, inconsistent data formats), and error handling mechanisms. To manage the project complexity, tasks will be broken down into smaller, manageable pieces. New considerations include support for custom roles, advanced summarization techniques, adaptive learning, and real-time updates. It would also be beneficial to research and implement multi-language support, especially for global users. The revised requirements should be reviewed by the team before moving forward. Assigned to: project-manager for review.",
