    "description": "Clearly outline the project's objectives, user stories, functional requirements, and non-functional requirements for BCI-powered art generation. This includes consideration of system architecture (consider using a microservices approach with separate services for data processing, real-time interaction, and artistic style customization), data processing (methods for translating brain activity into art and handling large datasets efficiently), real-time interaction (implementing low-latency communication mechanisms to ensure smooth user experience), and artistic style customization (providing a wide range of styles to cater to diverse user preferences). Also, include requirements for error handling, scalability, security, and accessibility.",
