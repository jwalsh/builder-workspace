    "title": "Design system architecture",
    "description": "Design the overall system architecture, including the frontend, backend, database, and any external integrations or services required. Consider the following aspects: \n\n1. Frontend: Decide on the technology stack (e.g., React, Angular, Vue) and the user interface design principles to ensure an intuitive and responsive experience for creating and exploring mind maps. Consider using a modern UI library or framework like Material-UI or Ant Design for a consistent and visually appealing interface.\n\n2. Backend: Choose a suitable backend framework (e.g., Node.js with Express, Django, Ruby on Rails) and design the API endpoints required for CRUD operations on mind maps, user authentication, and any other necessary functionality. Implement RESTful APIs and consider using GraphQL for efficient data fetching.\n\n3. Database: Evaluate the database requirements and select an appropriate database system (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) based on the data structure and querying needs. Consider using a document-oriented database like MongoDB for storing mind map data, and a relational database like PostgreSQL for user data and other structured data.\n\n4. External Services: Identify any external services or APIs required for features like real-time collaboration (e.g., Socket.IO, WebSockets), sharing (e.g., social media APIs), or integration with other learning platforms (e.g., LMS APIs).\n\n5. Scalability and Performance: Consider the scalability requirements and implement appropriate caching mechanisms (e.g., Redis), load balancing, and performance optimizations (e.g., code splitting, lazy loading).\n\n6. Security: Implement proper authentication (e.g., JWT, OAuth), authorization (e.g., role-based access control), and data encryption mechanisms (e.g., bcrypt for password hashing) to ensure the security of user data and mind maps. Consider implementing security best practices like input validation, sanitization, and protection against common web vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, CSRF).\n\n7. Deployment and DevOps: Plan for the deployment strategy (e.g., containerization with Docker, cloud deployment on AWS or GCP) and implement CI/CD pipelines for automated testing (e.g., Jest, Cypress) and deployment (e.g., GitHub Actions, CircleCI).\n\n8. Logging and Monitoring: Implement logging and monitoring mechanisms (e.g., Sentry, Datadog) to track application performance, errors, and user behavior for debugging and optimization purposes.",
