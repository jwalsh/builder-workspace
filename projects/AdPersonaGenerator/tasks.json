    "description": "Design the overall system architecture for the AdPersonaGenerator project. This will include data ingestion, processing, persona generation components, and data security measures. The design should prioritize scalability, performance, maintainability, and ethical implications while ensuring compliance with data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) and incorporating robust security measures to protect user data. The design phase will follow Project Planning and Requirements Gathering, and be followed by the Data Privacy and Compliance Review. Key considerations include: API design, microservices architecture, database schema design, containerization strategies for scalability and efficiency, and on-going monitoring and logging to ensure system performance and identify potential issues. Additionally, emphasize modularity and testability in the design, focusing on separation of concerns between different components. The design should also aim to optimize resource usage to minimize costs. Document the design using clear and concise technical documentation that can be easily understood by developers and other stakeholders. Upon completion, share the design with the assigned team members for further discussion and refinement. In case of any changes in the requirements during this process, update the RFC accordingly. Assign the task to the appropriate team member after finalizing the design.",
