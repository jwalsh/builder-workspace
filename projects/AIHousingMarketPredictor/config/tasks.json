    "description": "This RFC provides an updated design for the overall system architecture of AIHousingMarketPredictor, addressing scalability, fault tolerance, security, data privacy, and regulatory compliance aspects such as GDPR, CCPA, and industry-specific guidelines. The proposed design includes detailed component diagrams, a data architecture plan, and a modular structure for future improvements. Key considerations include a strategy for handling large volumes of data, real-time processing requirements, comprehensive testing, documentation, and machine learning model monitoring and continuous improvement strategies. To further ensure thoroughness, this RFC undergoes a security audit and addresses any potential vulnerabilities. The proposed design requires careful attention to the choice of technologies and tools, as well as the optimization of data flow between components. It is suggested that specific libraries, frameworks, or services be explicitly stated in the design for better understanding and ease of implementation. Lastly, consider integrating monitoring and alerting systems to ensure system health, performance, and potential issues are promptly identified. Please review the updated design and provide feedback or suggestions for improvements. If approved, I recommend assigning this task to a code-architect for further detail refinement.",
