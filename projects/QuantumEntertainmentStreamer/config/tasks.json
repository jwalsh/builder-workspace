    "description": "The detailed documentation of the project requirements is essential. This includes technical specifications for quantum entanglement streaming (clearly defining latency expectations, data transfer rates, error correction mechanisms, and discussing potential research on novel techniques like quantum error-correcting codes), user experience expectations (including cross-platform compatibility, responsive design, accessibility features, usability testing plans, focusing on mobile-first approach considering the widespread usage of smartphones and tablets, and outlining a plan for testing with diverse users to ensure inclusivity), target platforms (desktop, mobile, smart TV, VR/AR), security considerations (encryption methods, authentication protocols, data privacy measures, incident response plans, and discussing potential research on quantum key distribution for secure communication, focusing on the implementation of end-to-end encryption and multi-factor authentication), scalability and performance requirements (including load balancing strategies, caching mechanisms, and disaster recovery plans), relevant regulatory or legal constraints, potential integration with existing entertainment services, outlining the project's research needs, potential challenges, and contingency plans, identifying key stakeholders for collaboration, and emphasizing the importance of establishing a culture of continuous improvement within the development process.",
