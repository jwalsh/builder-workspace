    "title": "System Architecture Design",
    "description": "Design the overall system architecture, including components, data flow, and integration points. The architecture should be scalable, maintainable, modular, and performant while addressing edge cases, error handling, and optimization concerns. It should consider data storage, processing, and analysis requirements, as well as integration with external data sources such as geographic information systems (GIS), urban planning databases, community feedback platforms, and other relevant data sources like census data, zoning regulations, and environmental data. The architecture should also include provisions for data security, privacy, and access control mechanisms, ensuring compliance with industry standards. Additionally, consider the use of microservices architecture for better scalability and modularity. Lastly, document the design using technical diagrams and clear, concise descriptions to facilitate understanding among team members. Also, ensure that the architecture is designed in a way that allows for future AI and machine learning capabilities, as these technologies may become increasingly important in urban planning. Update the architecture design as needed based on feedback from project-manager and task-decomposer during the Project Planning and Requirements Gathering phase. Once the design is finalized, update the rfc_state to 'READY_FOR_CODE'.",
