    "description": "Design the overall system architecture for the AIUrbanRenewalPlanner project. The architecture should be scalable, maintainable, modular, and performant while addressing edge cases, error handling, and optimization concerns. It should consider data storage, processing, and analysis requirements, as well as integration with external data sources such as geographic information systems (GIS), urban planning databases, community feedback platforms, census data, zoning regulations, and environmental data. The architecture should also include provisions for data security, privacy, and access control mechanisms, ensuring compliance with industry standards and best practices. Consider using microservices architecture for better scalability and modularity. Document the design using technical diagrams and clear, concise descriptions to facilitate understanding among team members. Ensure that the architecture is designed in a way that allows for future AI and machine learning capabilities, as these technologies may become increasingly important in urban planning. Once the design is finalized, update the rfc_state to 'READY_FOR_CODE'.\n\n**Additional Considerations:**\n- Performance optimization techniques such as caching, indexing, and sharding should be considered.\n- The architecture should be designed with a focus on resilience, ensuring minimal downtime during maintenance or failure scenarios.\n- Monitoring and logging mechanisms should be implemented to aid in troubleshooting and performance tuning.",

Consider scalability, performance, data integrity, and data privacy requirements. Ensure compliance with relevant data protection regulations (such as GDPR for European users) and implement appropriate security measures like encryption at rest and in transit. The database design should also accommodate spatial data and geospatial analysis capabilities to support urban planning and visualization, focusing on optimizing the design for efficient querying and analysis while ensuring real-time updates. Collaborate with other team members to incorporate their feedback and align the design with the system architecture, keeping in mind that the database will be a crucial component of our machine learning models. Once completed, create comprehensive documentation detailing the database schema and data models, as well as usage instructions for developers working on related tasks.",
