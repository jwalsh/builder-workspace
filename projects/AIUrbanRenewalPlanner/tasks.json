The architecture should consider scalability, maintainability, modularity, and performance. It should also address data storage, processing, and analysis requirements, as well as integration with external data sources and systems like geographic information systems (GIS), urban planning databases, community feedback platforms, and other relevant data sources (e.g., census data, zoning regulations, environmental data). The architecture should also include provisions for data security, privacy, and access control mechanisms.",
