    "description": "Design the overall system architecture for the AIUrbanRenewalPlanner project. The architecture should be scalable, maintainable, modular, and performant while addressing edge cases, error handling, and optimization concerns. It should consider data storage, processing, and analysis requirements, as well as integration with external data sources such as geographic information systems (GIS), urban planning databases, community feedback platforms, census data, zoning regulations, and environmental data. The architecture should also include provisions for data security, privacy, and access control mechanisms, ensuring compliance with industry standards and best practices. Consider using microservices architecture for better scalability and modularity. Document the design using technical diagrams and clear, concise descriptions to facilitate understanding among team members. Ensure that the architecture is designed in a way that allows for future AI and machine learning capabilities, as these technologies may become increasingly important in urban planning. Additionally, consider performance optimization techniques such as caching, indexing, and sharding, and focus on resilience, ensuring minimal downtime during maintenance or failure scenarios. Implement monitoring and logging mechanisms to aid in troubleshooting and performance tuning. Once the design is finalized, update the rfc_state to 'READY_FOR_CODE'.\n\n**Additional Considerations:**\n- Performance optimization techniques such as caching, indexing, and sharding should be considered.\n- The architecture should be designed with a focus on resilience, ensuring minimal downtime during maintenance or failure scenarios.\n- Monitoring and logging mechanisms should be implemented to aid in troubleshooting and performance tuning.\n\n**New Considerations:**\n- Ensure the system is flexible enough to accommodate new urban planning methodologies and technologies as they emerge.\n- Incorporate principles of green and sustainable urban development in the design.\n- Implement a mechanism for continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) to streamline the development, testing, and release processes.\n\n**Assigned_to**: task-decomposer",

Consider scalability, performance, data integrity, and data privacy requirements (including GDPR for European users), implementing appropriate security measures like encryption at rest and in transit. The database design should also accommodate spatial data and geospatial analysis capabilities to support urban planning and visualization. Optimize the design for efficient querying and analysis while ensuring real-time updates. Collaborate with other team members, incorporating their feedback, and align the design with the system architecture. Upon completion, create comprehensive documentation detailing the database schema and data models, usage instructions for developers, focusing on usability and accessibility. Regularly update the documentation to reflect changes in the design or requirements. Provide examples or use cases to illustrate how the database will be used within the context of our machine learning models. Once the database design is finalized and the associated documentation is complete, conduct a code review with the assigned backend-developer and ensure they are comfortable with the design before moving forward. After the review, update the 'assigned_to' field to 'database-specialist' for implementation.",
