This includes gathering input from refinery operators, safety experts, regulatory bodies, potential users (if any), and relevant stakeholders. The aim is to create a comprehensive list of system capabilities, specifications, and user stories. To ensure thorough planning, consider conducting use case analysis, system architecture design, risk assessment, and stakeholder analysis. Once complete, prepare a technical document detailing the requirements. For better alignment with project goals, suggest including a section on performance benchmarks and scalability considerations.",
