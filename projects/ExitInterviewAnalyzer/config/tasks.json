    "description": "Thoroughly gather, document, and prioritize the requirements for the ExitInterviewAnalyzer system. This includes determining the types of data to be analyzed (e.g., text responses, numerical ratings), the desired outputs (e.g., trend reports, actionable insights, recommendations), and the stakeholders involved (e.g., HR department, executive leadership). Also, consider the data privacy and security implications, and outline the process for handling sensitive information in a manner compliant with relevant regulations such as GDPR or HIPAA. Ensure that the requirements are comprehensive, aligned with the project's overall goals, and can be easily understood by all involved parties. Provide clear examples or use cases to illustrate the expected functionality, emphasizing the importance of interpretability and actionability of results. Include any specific functionalities or integrations required for seamless data flow (e.g., API connections with HR systems). Upon completion, this task will be passed on to the project manager for further development planning.",

The data model should support efficient querying and analysis of the data, including text analysis and sentiment analysis on interview responses. Consider the different types of data that need to be stored, such as employee information, interview responses, analysis results, timestamps for interviews and updates, and any additional contextual data that may influence the analysis. Ensure that the data model supports privacy and security requirements for storing sensitive employee information, such as anonymization techniques (e.g., hashing, pseudonymization), proper access controls, and secure storage solutions. It would also be beneficial to include a versioning system for data updates and improvements over time. Lastly, consider integrating the data model with other systems or services for more comprehensive analysis, while ensuring that all interfaces meet our organization's API standards.",
