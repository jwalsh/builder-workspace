The data model should support efficient querying and analysis of the data, including text analysis and sentiment analysis on interview responses. Consider the different types of data that need to be stored, such as employee information, interview responses, and analysis results. Ensure that the data model supports privacy and security requirements for storing sensitive employee information, such as anonymization techniques and proper access controls. It would also be beneficial to include a versioning system for data updates and improvements over time. Lastly, consider integrating the data model with other systems or services for more comprehensive analysis.",
