    "description": "The detailed requirements for the CodePerformanceProfiler tool are gathered and documented. The scope includes supporting popular programming languages such as JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Ruby, PHP, Java, and others that are commonly used in web development. Performance metrics to analyze include execution time, memory usage, CPU utilization, network latency, I/O operations, and more. Optimization techniques to teach encompass algorithm optimization, code profiling, caching, data structure optimization, concurrency optimization, and more. The desired user experience involves a user-friendly interface, comprehensive reporting, integration with popular Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) like Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, or Atom, and a feature for suggesting optimization techniques based on the code analysis results. Additionally, it is important to consider incorporating an advanced search functionality for code snippets and documentation. This RFC is approved and ready for the next state, task decomposition.
