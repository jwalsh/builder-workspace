    "description": "Gather and document the detailed requirements for the CodePerformanceProfiler tool. The scope includes supporting popular programming languages such as JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Ruby, PHP, Java, and others that are commonly used in web development. Performance metrics to analyze include execution time, memory usage, CPU utilization, network latency, I/O operations, among others. Optimization techniques to teach encompass algorithm optimization, code profiling, caching, data structure optimization, concurrency optimization, and more. The desired user experience involves a user-friendly interface, comprehensive reporting, and integration with popular Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) like Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, or Atom. It is also important to consider incorporating a feature for suggesting optimization techniques based on the code analysis results.",
