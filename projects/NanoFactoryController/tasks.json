The architecture should consider scalability, fault tolerance, security, and performance requirements. Ensure that the design follows industry best practices, adheres to relevant standards, and includes a clear documentation for each component's role and responsibilities. Since this task involves critical system-level decisions, it is highly recommended to include a detailed analysis of potential trade-offs and their impact on the system's performance and scalability. The design should also provide an outline for the implementation plan.",
