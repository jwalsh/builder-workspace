The UI will be intuitive, responsive, and adhere to best practices for user experience (UX) design. It will cater to different user roles (Admin, Operator, Scientist) and access levels, seamlessly integrate with other system components, provide monitoring and control capabilities for molecular manufacturing processes, offer real-time feedback mechanisms, data visualization tools, error handling features, clear documentation, and a flexible design to accommodate future updates and expansions of the system. The UI design will be updated based on feedback received during the first iteration. This RFC serves as an update to the previous design version.",

The revised framework will include unit tests, integration tests, and system tests focusing on edge cases, error handling, performance optimizations, and security aspects. Ensure test coverage of all critical functionalities while considering best practices in test-driven development (TDD). Update the test framework to allow for easy maintenance, scalability, and extensibility. Incorporate a focus on test automation, continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) practices, and utilize techniques such as mocking, stubbing, and benchmarking. To further improve the quality and reliability of the testing framework, ensure compatibility with popular testing libraries, follow modern testing methodologies, and provide thorough documentation for future reference. Additionally, involve the QA tester team in the development process to validate the tests and provide feedback. If necessary, collaborate with other specialists (security-specialist, database-specialist) to address specific concerns such as security vulnerabilities or complex data operations.",
