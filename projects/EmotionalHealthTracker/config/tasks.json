Define architectural patterns (Microservices, RESTful API), consider scalability, security (using JWT for authentication and OWASP for security best practices, 2FA where possible), performance, maintainability, focusing on a modular design for easy updates and maintenance. This RFC also includes recommendations for data privacy (GDPR and CCPA compliance) and user consent management (in-app notifications, cookie policies). Implement HTTPS throughout the application. Include guidelines for error handling and logging. Consider integrating with mental health-focused AI services for additional features.",

Consider implementing differential privacy techniques to further protect user data. Update the schema with regular audits and versioning to ensure compliance with changing regulations. For optimal performance, use a combination of SQLite (for local storage) and a cloud-based solution (such as Amazon RDS or Google Cloud SQL).",
