Define the technology stack (React Native for mobile app, Node.js with Express for backend, MongoDB as primary database), architectural patterns (Microservices, RESTful API), and integration points (Firebase for real-time data sync, Stripe for in-app purchases). Consider scalability, security (using JWT for authentication and OWASP for security best practices), performance, and maintainability, focusing on a modular design for easy updates and maintenance. This RFC also includes recommendations for data privacy (GDPR and CCPA compliance) and user consent management (in-app notifications and cookie policies).",
