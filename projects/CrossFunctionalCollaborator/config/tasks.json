    "description": "Gather, document, and prioritize the functional and non-functional requirements for the CrossFunctionalCollaborator platform. Identify key features, user personas, use cases, edge cases, error handling mechanisms, performance optimization strategies, scalability considerations, and provide detailed breakdown of tasks for each role (frontend, backend, database, devops, etc.). Ensure adherence to best practices for maintainability, modularity, usability. Include a detailed documentation on how the platform will handle privacy and security concerns, focusing on GDPR, HIPAA, and other relevant regulations. Provide clear guidance on data retention, encryption, and user access control. Update the design to be mobile-friendly and accessible. Upon completion, tasks will be reassigned to appropriate team members for implementation. Update this RFC with a timeline for completion.",

The design should address the following aspects:\n\n- Modular and scalable architecture to accommodate future growth and changes\n- Separation of concerns between frontend, backend, and database layers\n- Robust API design for communication between frontend and backend\n- Database schema design for efficient data storage and retrieval\n- Integration with third-party services for authentication, notifications, or other functionalities\n- Security considerations, such as data encryption, access controls, and input validation\n- Performance optimizations, caching strategies, and load balancing\n- Deployment and infrastructure requirements (e.g., containerization, cloud hosting)\n- Monitoring, logging, and error handling mechanisms\n- Consider using microservices architecture for better scalability and maintainability.\n- Document the design decisions made, including reasons and trade-offs considered. Ensure to address any potential challenges in the development process.\n- The design should be compatible with our existing tech stack, and where possible, make use of open-source tools and libraries.",
