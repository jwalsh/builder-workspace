End-to-End Tests:\n- Test the complete system from the user's perspective.\n- Simulate real-world scenarios and user interactions.\n- Assess usability, accessibility, and responsiveness across different devices.\n\n4. Performance Tests:\n- Test the system's performance under various load conditions.\n- Identify and address any performance bottlenecks and scalability issues.\n- Measure the time taken for authentication decisions to ensure real-time response.\n\n5. Security Tests:\n- Test the system's security measures and vulnerability to potential threats.\n- Ensure proper authentication, authorization, and data protection mechanisms.\n- Perform penetration testing and vulnerability assessments.\n- Assess the resilience of the system against common attacks like DDoS and brute force.\n\n6. Compatibility Tests:\n- Test the system's compatibility with different operating systems, browsers, and devices.\n- Verify cross-browser compatibility and ensure consistent performance across all supported platforms.\n\n7. Usability Testing:\n- Evaluate the user interface for ease of use, intuitive navigation, and accessibility.\n\n8. Documentation:\n- Create clear and concise documentation detailing each test case, its purpose, expected results, and pass/fail criteria.\n- Update the testing environment setup instructions regularly to reflect changes in the system.\n\nThe test plan should also include details on the test automation strategies, data management, and reporting mechanisms.",
