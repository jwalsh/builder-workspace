Consider ensemble methods or hybrid approaches that combine different techniques for improved performance, while keeping scalability, performance, and privacy considerations in mind. To ensure robustness, include mechanisms for handling edge cases, error handling, and performance optimizations. Provide clear documentation on the model's architecture, algorithms used, and how the data will be processed to maintain transparency and compliance with privacy regulations.",
