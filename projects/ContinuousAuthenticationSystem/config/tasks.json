To ensure robustness, include mechanisms for handling edge cases, error handling, and performance optimizations. Provide clear documentation on the model's architecture, algorithms used, and how the data will be processed to maintain transparency and compliance with privacy regulations. Additionally, provide a more detailed plan for handling sensitive data and ensuring user consent, as well as discuss potential limitations of the chosen approach and propose mitigation strategies. To help the team understand the project better, provide use cases and examples demonstrating the proposed model's functionality.
