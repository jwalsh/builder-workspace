    "description": "Clearly outline the requirements for the SyncConflictResolver system. The system should handle various types of data (structured, unstructured, real-time, historical) and processes. Detail the desired resolution strategies (manual, automated, hybrid), the expected user experience (UI design, user feedback, notifications), integration points with existing systems or data sources, target platforms (web, mobile, APIs). Additionally, specify the required performance metrics, scalability needs, compliance or regulatory standards, and prioritize requirements based on user needs and system feasibility. Include a process for resolving conflicts when multiple stakeholders are involved. Note that the system should also accommodate real-time collaboration and decision-making. Update the 'assigned_to' field to 'task-decomposer' as this task requires further decomposition into smaller, manageable tasks.\n\nUpdate the 'rfc_state' field to 'REVIEWED' after review by the code-architect.",
