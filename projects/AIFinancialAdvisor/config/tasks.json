    "description": "Design the overall system architecture for AIFinancialAdvisor. This includes breaking down the task into smaller, manageable sub-tasks such as 'AI Model Selection', 'Data Storage and Processing Design', 'User Interface Design', and 'Integration Points Definition'. Each sub-task will have a defined timeline with estimated completion dates to facilitate better planning and coordination within the team. Address each aspect thoroughly while considering scalability, security, performance requirements, data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA), and web accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1). Outline the data storage and processing requirements using cloud solutions like AWS or Google Cloud, as well as the user interface and reporting components. Provide a detailed plan for developing, testing, and deploying the system, focusing on Agile methodologies for iterative development. Clarify dependency on 'Project Planning and Requirements Gathering' to ensure alignment with project objectives. Update the rfc_state field to 'IN_PROGRESS' as this task is ready for the code-architect or a suitable team member to begin working on it. Include a section on potential challenges and risks associated with each sub-task, along with proposed mitigation strategies to help in proactive risk management and ensure that the project stays on track. Update the rfc_state field to 'REVIEW_REQUIRED' as the suggested improvements need to be reviewed before moving forward.",

The UI should include dashboards, visualizations, and interactive features that allow users to input their financial information, goals, and risk profiles, and receive personalized recommendations and advice. Prioritize accessibility, responsiveness, modern design principles, adherence to industry standards and best practices for financial applications, and alignment with the overall system architecture and data models, considering future scalability and maintainability. Collaborate with the assigned frontend developer for implementation after completing the tasks listed as dependencies: System Architecture Design, User Research and Requirements Gathering, Data Modeling and Database Design. Upon completion of these dependencies, update the UI design in a way that can be easily handed over to the frontend developer for implementation. The UI design should include a clear plan for responsive design across various devices and screen sizes, and ensure compatibility with popular browsers. The design should also emphasize on providing a seamless user experience with a focus on usability and simplicity, and incorporate feedback from user research and requirements gathering to create a more personalized and effective interface. After the UI design is complete, share it with the frontend developer for implementation, and work together to make any necessary adjustments throughout the development process. Ensure that all updates to the UI design are documented and shared with relevant team members. If there are any concerns or questions about this RFC, please leave them in the review_comments field. Additionally, consider incorporating user feedback from existing financial advisory platforms for inspiration and improvement, and use tools like Figma or Sketch for UI design prototyping.",
