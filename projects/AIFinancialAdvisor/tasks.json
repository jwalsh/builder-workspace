Collaborate with the assigned frontend developer for implementation after completing the tasks listed as dependencies: System Architecture Design, User Research and Requirements Gathering, Data Modeling and Database Design. Upon completion of these dependencies, update the UI design in a way that can be easily handed over to the frontend developer for implementation. The UI design should include a clear plan for responsive design across various devices and screen sizes, and ensure compatibility with popular browsers. The design should also emphasize on providing a seamless user experience with a focus on usability and simplicity.",
