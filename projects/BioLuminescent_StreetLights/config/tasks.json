This task emphasizes the need for interdisciplinary collaboration between hardware engineers, material scientists, design specialists, biologists (for bioluminescent organism-related aspects), and project managers. The revised description includes a comprehensive design phase to accommodate all requirements and constraints, considering proper lighting distribution, environmental control, maintenance access, safety considerations, durability, weather resistance, easy installation and maintenance, compliance with relevant regulations and standards. The revised task will be further broken down into subtasks by the task-decomposer for efficient execution. \n\nThe task dependencies remain unchanged.\n\nTo ensure thoroughness and efficiency, it would be beneficial to include a software engineer to handle any necessary automation or control systems within the enclosures. Also, consider adding a safety engineer to address potential hazards in the design and manufacturing process.\n\nTask state is changed to 'DECOMPOSE'.",
