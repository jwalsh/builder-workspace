This includes databases, data models, APIs for storing and retrieving user data, device telemetry, and environmental data. The system will prioritize data privacy and security by ensuring compliance with relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA). Additionally, consider implementing features such as: offline data storage and synchronization, data encryption, an option for users to revoke access to their data, and a user-friendly interface. The design should be reviewed by the Data Architect before implementation. After implementation, the system will undergo security testing prior to deployment. Upon completion of the security testing, assign the task to the QA Tester for functional testing. Update the data architecture to be scalable and ready for future features.",
