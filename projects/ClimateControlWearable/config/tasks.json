This includes hardware components, software modules, communication protocols, data flow, integration points, and addressing the following aspects: 1) Wearable device hardware (sensors, actuators, power source, etc.), 2) Mobile app or companion device for user interface and control, 3) Cloud backend for data processing, storage, and remote management, 4) Communication protocols between components (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, cellular, etc.), 5) Data security and privacy considerations, 6) Scalability and performance requirements, 7) Fault tolerance and error handling mechanisms, 8) Energy efficiency considerations due to power source constraints. Also, provide a clear delineation of responsibilities for each team member during the implementation phase, with specific tasks and deadlines. This RFC assumes that the project scope and requirements have been defined in a previous RFC (Task: Define Project Scope and Requirements).",

Update the data architecture to be scalable and ready for future features. The design should be reviewed by the Data Architect before implementation. After implementation, the system will undergo security testing prior to deployment.",
