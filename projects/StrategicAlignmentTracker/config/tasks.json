    "description": "This task has been updated to comprehensively gather and document the detailed requirements for the StrategicAlignmentTracker tool. The updated requirements include: specifying the types of strategic goals and initiatives to be tracked, outlining desired visualization and reporting capabilities, detailing integration requirements with existing systems, defining user roles, permissions, and access levels, addressing data security and privacy considerations, and including any other functional and non-functional requirements. Additionally, a clear process for feedback and iterative refinement of the tool's design has been established. The updated requirements will be used to guide the next stages of development.",
