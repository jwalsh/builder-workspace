    "description": "This RFC proposes to clearly define the scope and requirements for the blockchain-based product tracking and verification system. The technical requirements will address stakeholder needs, system constraints, expected functionality, data models, security considerations (including potential attack vectors and mitigation strategies), scalability requirements, performance expectations, integration points with existing systems, and user experience design considerations. The functional and non-functional requirements will be clearly defined, along with an outline for the system architecture. A plan for testing and validation processes will be provided, including a timeline for milestones and key deliverables. Edge cases, error handling mechanisms, potential future expansions or upgrades of the system, and industry best practices, regulations, and standards will also be considered in the design and implementation. \n\nPlease note that this RFC is currently in the 'READY_FOR_APPROVAL' state and assigned to the project manager. Upon approval, the next step would be task decomposition by the code architect or relevant team members.\n\n**Proposed Changes:** Add more specific details on the expected functionality of the system, such as real-time tracking capabilities, data encryption methods, user roles and permissions, and integration with popular logistics software.\n\n**Recommendation:** Upon approval, this RFC should be assigned to the code architect for task decomposition.",
