    "description": "Gather and document the project requirements, including the types of competitor data to be collected (e.g., pricing, product features, market share, customer reviews, social media mentions), the analysis methods to be used (sentiment analysis, trend analysis, competitive benchmarking, predictive modeling), the desired output formats for strategic insights (reports, dashboards, alerts, data visualizations), and any specific performance, scalability, or security requirements. Clearly outline the expected user roles, permissions, and access levels within the system, with a focus on differentiating between admin, analyst, and viewer roles. Additionally, specify any additional APIs or third-party services that may be required, along with their functionalities, and consider potential integration with CRM/ERP systems if applicable. Provide examples of specific use cases to demonstrate the tool's effectiveness. In addition, establish a process for updating the system as new competitors emerge and market conditions change, with an emphasis on automating this process where possible. Furthermore, outline any potential data privacy concerns and strategies for addressing them. In case of integration with CRM/ERP systems, specify how user authentication and authorization will be managed. If applicable, provide guidelines for customizing the tool to meet specific industry or company needs. In the revised RFC, include a section discussing the overall timeline and milestones for the project's completion. Lastly, update the task status as 'REVIEW_REQUIRED' since this RFC requires code-architect review before proceeding.",
