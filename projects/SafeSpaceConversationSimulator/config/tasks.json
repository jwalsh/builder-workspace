    "description": "Revised and expanded the gathered requirements for the SafeSpaceConversationSimulator. The project aims to provide a VR tool for employees at all levels, offering various use cases such as feedback scenarios, conflict resolution, team communication exercises, and role-playing simulations. Desired features include a customizable VR environment, characters, real-time analytics, a feedback tracking system, user preference options including language choices and accessibility settings, and an intuitive user interface. Additional requirements are the integration of AI for realistic character responses, and the ability to save and revisit scenarios for further practice.",

Notification of deployment status via email, Slack, or other communication channels\n10. Automated rollback mechanism in case of failure during deployment\n11. Support for code linting and auto-formatting\n12. Incorporate the use of Docker containers for consistent environment setup across different platforms.\n\nThe pipeline should be configured to automatically trigger on code commits to the main branch and also support manual triggers for deploying specific versions to staging or production environments. Additionally, consider incorporating feedback from the frontend-developer, backend-developer, and database-specialist during configuration for optimal results.\n\n* Note: It would be beneficial to schedule regular reviews of the CI/CD pipeline by the team to ensure its efficiency and effectiveness.*",
