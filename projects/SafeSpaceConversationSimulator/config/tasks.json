Support for code linting and auto-formatting\n12. Incorporate the use of Docker containers for consistent environment setup across different platforms.\n\nThe pipeline should be configured to automatically trigger on code commits to the main branch and also support manual triggers for deploying specific versions to staging or production environments. Additionally, consider incorporating feedback from the frontend-developer, backend-developer, and database-specialist during configuration for optimal results.\n\n* Note: It would be beneficial to schedule regular reviews of the CI/CD pipeline by the team to ensure its efficiency and effectiveness.*",
