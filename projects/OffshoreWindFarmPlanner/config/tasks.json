This task follows completion of Project Planning and Requirements Gathering, Environmental Data Analysis, and Wind Energy Modeling. Focus on creating an extensible system with clean interfaces that facilitates easy integration of future features and consider the use of microservices architecture to enable this. Review and incorporate feedback from cross-functional team members as needed. Prepare a technical design document detailing the proposed architecture and present it to the team for discussion and refinement. This task is currently assigned to the code-architect but may require collaboration with frontend-developer, backend-developer, database-specialist, devops-engineer, qa-tester, security-specialist, and technical-writer.",
