    "description": "Gather and document the project requirements as follows: (1) Identify and collaborate with subject matter experts or consultants to guide the exploration of target theories of consciousness. (2) Determine the desired level of detail, accuracy, and immersion for the simulations and thought experiments, considering industry best practices and user expectations. (3) Design the overall structure and flow of the experience, ensuring a coherent and engaging sequence of modules or levels that cater to the target audience's understanding and enjoyment. (4) Develop an intuitive and immersive user interface and interaction methods tailored for the chosen VR platforms, prioritizing usability, accessibility, and performance optimizations. (5) Specify data requirements, including user progress tracking, preference management, and content generation, considering privacy and performance implications, while also addressing edge cases, error handling, and scalability considerations. (6) Establish the project's scope, timeline, and budget constraints, outlining key milestones and resources required. (7) Identify potential risks and propose mitigation strategies to ensure successful project completion. (8) Define the team composition and roles necessary for successful execution, ensuring a balanced skill set and clear communication channels. Additionally, consider performance optimizations, edge cases, error handling, and scalability when making decisions.",
