    "title": "Define Project Scope and Requirements - REVISED",
    "description": "Gather and document the project requirements as follows: (1) Identify and collaborate with subject matter experts or consultants to guide the exploration of target theories of consciousness. (2) Determine the desired level of detail, accuracy, and immersion for the simulations and thought experiments, considering industry best practices and user expectations while also prioritizing education and engagement. (3) Design the overall structure and flow of the experience, ensuring a coherent and engaging sequence of modules or levels that cater to the target audience's understanding and enjoyment, emphasizing an interactive and intuitive learning process. (4) Develop an immersive user interface and interaction methods tailored for the chosen VR platforms, prioritizing usability, accessibility, performance optimizations, and adaptability to various hardware specifications. (5) Specify data requirements, including user progress tracking, preference management, and content generation, considering privacy and performance implications, while also addressing edge cases, error handling, and scalability considerations, focusing on maintaining data integrity and security. (6) Establish the project's scope, timeline, and budget constraints, outlining key milestones and resources required, prioritizing feasibility and realism in setting deadlines and expectations. (7) Identify potential risks and propose mitigation strategies to ensure successful project completion while also monitoring and adapting to emerging trends and technology advancements. (8) Define the team composition and roles necessary for successful execution, ensuring a balanced skill set, clear communication channels, and agile methodologies that prioritize collaboration and adaptability. Additionally, consider performance optimizations, edge cases, error handling, and scalability when making decisions. However, to ensure clarity, it would be beneficial to break down the tasks in points (6) and (8) into more specific actionable items. In point (6), it might be useful to specify the main deliverables that will help define the scope and timeline of the project. In point (8), listing the exact roles required and their responsibilities would provide a clearer understanding of the team structure. Finally, suggest any necessary improvements or changes in the 'assigned_to' field for further progress.",
