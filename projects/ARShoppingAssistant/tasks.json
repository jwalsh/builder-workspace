The design should consider scalability, performance, security, maintainability, modularity, edge cases, error handling, and performance optimizations. Provide detailed documentation and diagrams to communicate the architecture to stakeholders. Ensure the design aligns with best practices for AR, mobile app development, and microservices architecture. After completion, review the design with project-manager and code-architect before proceeding. Include a focus on accessibility and usability in the design, and consider how the system will be monitored and maintained over time.",
