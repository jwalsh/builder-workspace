The solution should support efficient data ingestion, querying, and archiving. Consider utilizing a combination of databases (e.g., relational, NoSQL, time-series) based on the data characteristics and access patterns to optimize performance. Implement replication, backup, and access control mechanisms for data durability, availability, and security. Incorporate a data lake or data warehouse solution for long-term storage and analysis of historical data. Ensure the data storage solution seamlessly integrates with the overall system architecture and provides APIs or interfaces for other components to interact with it. (Note: A comprehensive analysis of the system's data requirements is needed before finalizing the database choices.) To guarantee a successful implementation, I recommend assigning subtasks to frontend-developer, backend-developer, database-specialist, and devops-engineer for optimal integration, configuration, deployment, and operation. Ensure that data privacy and security are prioritized throughout the design process by involving a security-specialist when making decisions related to access control and encryption. (Note: The RFC is ready for implementation. Update the 'implementation_state' field accordingly.)",

    "description": "The task aims to enhance the security of the AnomalyDetectionEngine by implementing a comprehensive security and access control system. This includes but is not limited to: developing role-based access control with multi-factor authentication, data encryption at rest using AES-256 and in transit using RSA/TLS, adhering to OWASP and CIS security standards, secure coding practices (e.g., input validation, output encoding, secure session management), regular security audits and vulnerability assessments, incident response procedures, maintaining a comprehensive log of security events for analysis. Additionally, industry-standard key management practices will be employed, such as using Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) or cloud-based key management services. Upon successful implementation, the system will demonstrate secure communication protocols, adherence to security standards, and resilience against potential threats. To ensure the effectiveness of these measures, it is recommended to engage a dedicated Security Specialist during the development process for ongoing guidance and consultation. This task also emphasizes the importance of regular training and awareness programs for all team members on security best practices. The scope has been expanded to include implementation of Identity Access Management (IAM) system and integration with Single Sign-On (SSO) solutions.",
