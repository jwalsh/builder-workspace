    "description": "Design the overall architecture of the AnomalyDetectionEngine, including the components, data flow, communication between subsystems, and integration with external systems/services. Ensure the architecture is modular, scalable, secure, performant, maintainable, and follows best practices for data ingestion, processing, storage, and analysis pipelines. Consider using microservices, event-driven architecture, containerization, and serverless functions for improved scalability and maintainability. Address high availability, fault tolerance, and disaster recovery requirements. Outline monitoring and logging strategies. Implement edge case handling, error management, and performance optimizations. Incorporate the feedback from 'Define Project Scope and Requirements', 'Identify External Systems/Services', and 'Conduct Risk Assessment and Threat Modeling'. Once complete, conduct a code review with the relevant team members to ensure adherence to standards. Update design documentation accordingly. To improve clarity, break down the architecture design into subtasks as follows: \n  1. Design data ingestion and processing pipeline\n  2. Design system components and their interconnections\n  3. Design communication protocols between subsystems\n  4. Design monitoring and logging strategies\n  5. Design edge case handling, error management, and performance optimizations\n  6. Design disaster recovery and fault tolerance mechanisms\n  7. Design integration with external systems/services\n Once each subtask is complete, update the design documentation accordingly. This approach will make the task more manageable and transparent. The task has been refined to improve clarity and provide a clearer roadmap for completion.\n\nAfter reviewing, I suggest the following changes:\n- Clarify that the 'Design System Architecture' task includes the creation of data models and schema designs as well as architecture diagrams.\n- Add a requirement to document any assumptions made during the design process, particularly around performance, scalability, and security.\n- Encourage the use of continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) practices throughout the development and implementation of the system architecture.",

    "description": "Design and implement a scalable, high-performance, and secure data storage solution for storing and retrieving anomaly data, system logs, and other relevant information. The solution should support efficient data ingestion, querying, and archiving. Consider utilizing a combination of databases (e.g., relational, NoSQL, time-series) based on the data characteristics and access patterns to optimize performance. Implement replication, backup, and access control mechanisms for data durability, availability, and security. Incorporate a data lake or data warehouse solution for long-term storage and analysis of historical data. Ensure the data storage solution seamlessly integrates with the overall system architecture and provides APIs or interfaces for other components to interact with it. (Note: A comprehensive analysis of the system's data requirements is needed before finalizing the database choices.) To guarantee a successful implementation, I recommend assigning a code-architect or task-decomposer to further break down this task into smaller, manageable subtasks. Additionally, consider involving frontend-developer and backend-developer expertise for optimal integration with the system, as well as database-specialist and devops-engineer for database configuration and deployment. Ensure that data privacy and security are prioritized throughout the design process by involving a security-specialist when making decisions related to access control and encryption. (Note: The RFC is ready for implementation. Update the 'implementation_state' field accordingly.)",
