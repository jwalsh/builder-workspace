Ensure the architecture is modular, scalable, secure, performant, maintainable, and follows best practices for data ingestion, processing, storage, and analysis pipelines. Consider using microservices, event-driven architecture, containerization, and serverless functions for improved scalability and maintainability. Address high availability, fault tolerance, and disaster recovery requirements. Outline monitoring and logging strategies. Implement edge case handling, error management, and performance optimizations. Incorporate the feedback from 'Define Project Scope and Requirements', 'Identify External Systems/Services', and 'Conduct Risk Assessment and Threat Modeling'. Once complete, conduct a code review with the relevant team members to ensure adherence to standards. Update design documentation accordingly.",

Ensure data durability, availability, and security through appropriate replication, backup, and access control mechanisms. Additionally, implement a data lake or data warehouse solution for long-term storage and analysis of historical data. The data storage solution should integrate with the overall system architecture and provide APIs or interfaces for other components to interact with it.",
