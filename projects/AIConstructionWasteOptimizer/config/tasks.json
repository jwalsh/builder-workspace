    "description": "Define project scope, objectives, and requirements. Conduct research on construction waste management practices, regulations, and existing solutions using surveys, interviews, and literature reviews. Engage with stakeholders from various domains (construction companies, waste management facilities, relevant government agencies) to gain insights. Identify key features and functionalities such as material demand forecasting, waste tracking, recycling opportunities identification, and regulatory compliance. Consider data sources, integration requirements, user interface design, and potential machine learning models for optimization (e.g., time-series forecasting, clustering algorithms). Prepare a comprehensive documentation outlining project scope, goals, and proposed solution architecture. Include specific user stories, wireframes, and potential prototype demonstrations when possible. Upon completion, the document will be presented to the Project Manager for further decomposition and planning. This phase requires involvement from Code Architect (for system design), Frontend Developer (for UI/UX design), Backend Developer (for server-side logic), Database Specialist (for data modeling), DevOps Engineer (for deployment strategy), QA Tester (for testing the system), Security Specialist (for securing the system), and Technical Writer (for documentation). It is crucial to involve these team members during this phase for their expertise and feedback. **Improvements: Include details on the methodology of research, potential data analysis techniques (e.g., statistical analysis, text mining), specific machine learning algorithms to be used (e.g., Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, or Neural Networks), potential data sources, integration requirements with existing systems in the construction and waste management industries, and any unique challenges or constraints that might affect the project.**\n\nNote: It is recommended to update the rfc_state field from 'UNKNOWN' to 'READY_FOR_PROJECT_MANAGER'.",

    "title": "System Architecture Design",
    "description": "Design the overall system architecture, including components, data flow, and integration points. Define the AI model architecture and algorithms for waste prediction and optimization. The design should include:\n- Data ingestion pipeline (from construction management systems and other data sources)\n- Data preprocessing (cleaning, feature engineering)\n- Model training and evaluation (supervised learning, time-series forecasting)\n- Deployment and monitoring (containerization, orchestration, monitoring)\n- User interface (web application or mobile app)\n- Integration with construction management systems (APIs, data exchange formats). Additionally, consider edge cases, error handling, and performance optimizations throughout the system design. Detailed documentation of each component and its interactions should be provided, along with a plan for testing and validation. The design should also address scalability, security, and compliance with relevant data privacy regulations. To facilitate easy updates and maintenance, implement modularity in the design.\n\n*Note: Please ensure that the design takes into account potential future expansion of the system, such as new data sources or integration with additional construction management systems.\n\n**Additional Considerations:**\n- Performance benchmarking during development and testing to ensure system efficiency\n- Implementing a logging mechanism for monitoring and troubleshooting purposes\n- Ensuring that the system is accessible and usable for non-technical users\n- Exploring opportunities for open-source integration or collaboration where applicable\n- Consider adding a section for disaster recovery planning in the design.\n\nIf the design is ready for further review, update the rfc_state field accordingly.",
