    "description": "Clearly define the project scope, objectives, key requirements, and constraints for the LeadershipStyleAnalyzer system. Identify the target users (Corporate leaders, HR managers, and trainers), use cases (Leadership behavior analysis, Effectiveness evaluation, Improvement suggestions), and data sources (Interviews, Observations, Feedback surveys). Outline the system architecture, including components for data ingestion (Data preprocessing, Data validation), processing (Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning models), analysis (Trend analysis, Comparative analysis), reporting (Dashboard, Reports), and consider integration with existing HRMS systems. Consider scalability, security, compliance requirements, and provide a plan for handling sensitive data. Provide clear documentation for each module, including the API endpoints, expected inputs, outputs, and error handling.",
