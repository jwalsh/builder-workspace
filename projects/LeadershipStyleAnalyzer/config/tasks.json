    "description": "Clearly define the project scope, objectives, key requirements, and constraints for the LeadershipStyleAnalyzer system. Identify the target users (Corporate leaders, HR managers, and trainers), use cases (Leadership behavior analysis, Effectiveness evaluation, Improvement suggestions), and data sources (Interviews, Observations, Feedback surveys). Outline the system architecture, including components for data ingestion (Data preprocessing, Data validation, Include Data Privacy and Anonymization considerations), processing (Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning models - specify more details on the choice of specific models and techniques to ensure transparency and explainability, mention potential use of transformers-based models for text analysis), analysis (Trend analysis, Comparative analysis, Time series analysis, Anomaly detection), reporting (Dashboard, Reports, Allow for customizable reports and export options, Consider accessibility, internationalization, usability in design), integration with existing HRMS systems. Discuss scalability, security, compliance requirements (Data protection regulations, Industry standards, GDPR compliance, etc.), and provide a plan for handling sensitive data (Encryption, Access controls, Data minimization). Provide clear documentation for each module, including the API endpoints, expected inputs, outputs, and error handling, and add documentation guidelines for developers. Include testing strategies and performance benchmarks in the documentation. Discuss potential use of agile methodologies in development process and provide a plan for iterative releases. Update the 'assigned_to' field to 'task-decomposer'. Provide more specific timelines for each module in the implementation plan, if available. If necessary, collaborate with other team members to break down tasks into smaller, manageable units.<br>",
