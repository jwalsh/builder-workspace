This includes specifying the types of metrics to be monitored, prioritizing preferred anomaly detection algorithms based on accuracy and computational efficiency, defining the expected system performance and scalability, establishing data storage and retention policies, detailing user interface and reporting requirements, addressing security and privacy concerns, outlining integration with existing monitoring and alerting systems, and considering accessibility standards. Upon completion, this document will serve as a foundation for the design and development phases of the project. The RFC is currently in DRAFT state, awaiting further input or refinement.",
