    "description": "This RFC aims to comprehensively gather and document the requirements for the MetricAnomalyDetector system. The system will monitor various types of metrics (system, application, network), prioritizing preferred anomaly detection algorithms based on accuracy and computational efficiency (such as Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, or Long Short-Term Memory networks). It is expected to handle large data sets and high concurrency, while adhering to data storage and retention policies considering compliance regulations. The user interface will include real-time monitoring, customizable alerts, and historical trend analysis. Security and privacy concerns will be addressed by implementing encryption, access controls, anonymization techniques. Integration with existing monitoring and alerting systems (like Prometheus, Grafana, or Nagios) is considered. Accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance) will be followed. The document will outline assumptions and limitations, and it's recommended to consider cloud-based solutions for improved scalability and cost efficiency. Upon completion, this document will serve as a foundation for the design and development phases of the project. The RFC is currently in DRAFT state, awaiting further input or refinement. Please note that while machine learning techniques are essential, it's crucial to ensure their interpretability and explainability for better understanding and trust-building with users. Upon review, I suggest updating the 'rfc_state' field to 'NEEDS_REVIEW'.",

    "description": "Design the overall architecture of the MetricAnomalyDetector system, including components, data flow, integration points with other systems, scalability considerations, security measures, and provide a detailed design documentation for each component. Include a clear explanation of how the chosen anomaly detection algorithms (such as Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, or Autoencoder) will be implemented within the system. Utilize containerization with Docker and deployment on Kubernetes for scalability and ease of maintenance. Provide more details about the specific roles and responsibilities of each component in the system. Elaborate on the expected performance metrics, and provide a timeline for each milestone. Include a section on error handling and exception cases. Additionally, offer suggestions for improvement in the chosen algorithms, consider the use of AI/ML libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch, and include a plan for A/B testing and version control. Suggested improvements: Update the 'assigned_to' field to 'code-architect', provide a more detailed timeline for each milestone, consider using AI/ML libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch, and include a plan for A/B testing and version control.<br>This description contains line breaks for readability only, they do not affect the validity of the JSON object>",
