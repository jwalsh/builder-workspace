This includes functional and non-functional requirements, performance expectations, integration with existing systems (such as police databases, communication systems, etc.), data privacy and security considerations (including GDPR, HIPAA compliance), regulatory compliance, and detailed error handling mechanisms. The documentation should also cover user interface design for law enforcement personnel and potential integrations with other AI-powered systems. Also, outline the testing strategies and methodologies to validate the system's functionality and performance.",

Ensure that the environment supports collaboration, code review (e.g., GitHub Pull Requests or Gerrit), and automated testing (e.g., unit, integration, and end-to-end tests). Implement best practices for security (e.g., secure coding practices, vulnerability scanning, and access controls), scalability (e.g., containerization with Docker or Kubernetes), and maintainability (e.g., modular design, code documentation, and automated dependency updates). Additionally, set up a staging environment for testing and a production environment for deployment, with appropriate monitoring (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) and logging (e.g., ELK Stack or Splunk) solutions for better visibility and troubleshooting.",
