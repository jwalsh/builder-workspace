    "description": "This RFC aims to gather, document, and update the comprehensive requirements for the BodyCamAIAnalyzer system. The documentation should include functional and non-functional requirements, performance expectations, integration with existing systems such as police databases, communication systems, and potential AI-powered systems. It should also address data privacy and security considerations including GDPR, HIPAA compliance, regulatory compliance, and detailed error handling mechanisms. The user interface design for law enforcement personnel is to be included, along with testing strategies and methodologies to validate the system's functionality and performance. The document will also outline potential integrations with other AI-powered systems, detail the testing strategies and methodologies, and provide guidelines for maintaining and updating the system. The RFC should also consider the scalability of the system as it is expected to handle large amounts of data in real-time. In addition, the RFC should address any potential ethical considerations related to law enforcement AI systems. Upon completion, this document will serve as a foundation for the development and implementation phases of the BodyCamAIAnalyzer project.",
