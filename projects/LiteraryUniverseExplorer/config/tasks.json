    "description": "Gather and document the project's requirements, including the desired features, user experience, technical specifications, and scalability considerations for the AI-generated literary universe. Ensure that the requirements cover the following aspects: narrative generation algorithms (investigate various AI models such as recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory networks, and transformers), user personalization and preference tracking, content moderation (consider AI-based solutions to identify inappropriate content), user interface design (collaborate with UX/UI designers for a seamless and engaging experience), database architecture (design a scalable NoSQL or SQL database structure for efficient storage and retrieval of user data, storylines, and preferences), integration with third-party services (if any; identify potential APIs to use), and testing and security considerations. Upon completion, create a comprehensive technical document that outlines the system architecture, API specifications, and overall project roadmap. Once approved, task may be delegated for further decomposition.",
