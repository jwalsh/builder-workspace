    "description": "Design the overall system architecture, including components, interfaces, and data flow. Ensure scalability, maintainability, extensibility, and consider security, performance, error handling, and integration with existing systems or third-party services. The architecture should include the following components: a frontend user interface (consider using modern technologies such as React or Angular for faster development and implementing server-side rendering (SSR) for better SEO and performance), a backend server (specifically, a Node.js server for better scalability and compatibility), a solution generation engine, a solution explanation module, a database for storing solutions and user data (consider using MongoDB for its flexible schema design and high performance), an integration layer for third-party services (e.g., code execution environments, external knowledge bases). The architecture should follow a modular and layered approach, with clear separation of concerns and well-defined interfaces between components. Incorporate best practices for security, such as input validation, authentication, and authorization mechanisms (OAuth2 is recommended), consider using containerization technologies like Docker for better isolation and deployment flexibility. Consider performance optimizations, such as caching, load balancing, and asynchronous processing. Ensure proper error handling and logging mechanisms are in place, and consider using tools like ELK Stack or Splunk for centralized logging. Provide for extensibility and scalability by designing loosely coupled components and using appropriate design patterns, ensuring adherence to Microservices Architecture principles where possible. Include detailed documentation for each component and their interactions, and provide clear instructions for integration with other components and third-party services. Upon completion, conduct a code review and address any feedback before moving to the next phase. Assign this task to the 'code-architect' or 'project-manager' for further refinement.",

    "description": "Design and implement the database schema for the AlternativeSolutionExplorer project. The schema should include: coding problems, solutions, alternative solutions, explanations, related metadata, user interactions, and system events. Support efficient querying and retrieval of data, scalability, performance optimizations, and high availability. Consider using a hybrid approach with MongoDB (version 4.4) for storing unstructured data like solutions and Neo4j (version 4.3) for graph-based data like relationships between problems, solutions, and explanations. Implement caching mechanisms using Redis for frequently accessed data. Ensure that the cache implementation adheres to best practices for consistency (e.g., using a consistent hashing strategy). Implement an eviction strategy such as LRU or ARC based on the nature of data. Ensure data integrity, security, and backup strategies by using appropriate access controls, encryption at rest, and frequent backups. Implement replication for high availability and disaster recovery. After completing the initial design, perform unit testing and integration testing to validate functionality before moving to production. Collaborate with the assigned team members (e.g., task-decomposer, project-manager) during the implementation process. In addition, consider using a microservices architecture for improved scalability and maintainability. Also, document the database design in a clear and concise manner to facilitate understanding by other team members. Furthermore, perform a thorough analysis of the system's load patterns to optimize cache strategies accordingly, and explore using a combination of cache-aside and write-through strategies for optimal performance. Lastly, implement monitoring tools such as Prometheus for real-time performance analysis and alerting in case of any anomalies. Additionally, I would like to suggest adding specific security measures such as JWT for authentication and OAuth2 for authorization.
