This includes a comprehensive list of desired features, performance criteria, security considerations, relevant regulations or policies, data privacy and ethical concerns, potential risks or limitations, future scalability and maintainability considerations, and any other important factors that could impact the system. Collaborate with all relevant stakeholders to ensure all areas are covered. The focus should be on creating a detailed technical specification for the project. Once complete, this document will serve as the blueprint for the development team.",
