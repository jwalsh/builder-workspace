    "description": "Update the scope, requirements, and constraints for the LicensePlateTracker project. This includes a comprehensive list of desired features, performance criteria, security considerations (including GDPR and local privacy laws), relevant regulations or policies, data privacy and ethical concerns, potential risks or limitations, future scalability and maintainability considerations, and any other important factors that could impact the system. Collaborate with all relevant stakeholders to ensure all areas are covered, including representatives from legal, compliance, city government offices, AI/ML specialists for optimal AI algorithm selection, infrastructure specialists for network and hardware requirements, database experts for data storage solutions, API developers for defining and implementing API endpoints, and UI/UX designers for user-friendly interface design. The focus should be on creating a detailed technical specification for the project that addresses all these aspects. Once complete, this document will serve as the blueprint for the development team. After review and feedback from all stakeholders, this RFC will be updated to STATE_FOR_APPROVAL. This task is intended for the code-architect, but it would be beneficial to involve other team members during the documentation phase, especially UI/UX designers for user interface considerations. Ensure that any updates or changes made are reflected in the 'rfc_state' field accordingly.",
