    "description": "Gather, document, and prioritize the requirements for the DroneDeliveryHub system. This includes functional and non-functional requirements, stakeholder needs, system constraints, regulatory compliance, integration with existing systems, and potential future scalability considerations. Additionally, outline any necessary interfaces between different components of the system, as well as performance metrics and security standards to ensure safe and efficient operation. Since this task involves a high level of architecture design, it is recommended to consider edge cases and failure scenarios for robustness and reliability. Furthermore, identify potential areas for machine learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) integration, with a focus on specific use-cases such as route optimization, predictive maintenance, and anomaly detection in the drone delivery process. Include any research or benchmarks that support the chosen approaches and ML/AI models, when applicable. Lastly, consider addressing the following questions: What are the key system architecture components? How will they interact with each other? How will data flow through the system? Are there any potential bottlenecks or areas of concern in terms of scalability or security? The task is now ready for review by the assigned team member. Please provide feedback and suggestions within this RFC document.",
