    "description": "This RFC focuses on gathering, documenting, and prioritizing the requirements for the DroneDeliveryHub system. The scope includes functional and non-functional requirements, stakeholder needs, system constraints, regulatory compliance, integration with existing systems, and potential future scalability considerations. Interfaces between different components of the system will be outlined, along with performance metrics and security standards to ensure safe and efficient operation. Edge cases and failure scenarios will be considered for robustness and reliability. Potential areas for machine learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) integration will be identified, with a focus on specific use-cases such as route optimization, predictive maintenance, and anomaly detection in the drone delivery process. Research or benchmarks supporting chosen approaches and ML/AI models will be included where applicable. The key system architecture components, their interactions, data flow, potential bottlenecks, and areas of concern in terms of scalability or security will also be addressed. This task is now ready for review by the assigned team member.",
