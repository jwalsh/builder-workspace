    "description": "This RFC proposes a system architecture design for the RealTimeTranslator project. The focus is on components, interfaces, data flow, deployment strategy, and choice of technologies/frameworks to prioritize scalability, fault tolerance, security, performance requirements, real-time processing needs, modular design for future upgrades/integrations, and compliance with data privacy regulations. Key aspects include: 1) Microservices architecture for scalability and easy maintenance; 2) Use of AI technologies such as Speech Recognition (SR), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Machine Translation (MT); 3) Deployment on cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud to leverage their services for scalability, reliability, and security. The design also includes a robust testing strategy with the involvement of QA testers throughout the development process.",
