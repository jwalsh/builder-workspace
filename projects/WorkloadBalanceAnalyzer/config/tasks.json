Also, define the interface for users to opt-in, customize their preferences, and adjust settings according to their roles or teams. Furthermore, discuss potential integration with existing systems and APIs, data privacy considerations, and security measures. Lastly, outline a plan for ongoing maintenance, updates, and improvements based on user feedback.",
