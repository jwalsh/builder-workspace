This includes designing the detector array, data processing pipeline, data storage, visualization components, and infrastructure. The design should consider scalability, fault tolerance, security, performance requirements, real-time constraints, and energy efficiency of cosmic phenomena observations. The design will be broken down into subtasks for easier implementation. The RFC is detailed but could benefit from further exploration on the specific technologies to be used in each component (e.g., detector array technology, data processing pipeline software, etc.).",
