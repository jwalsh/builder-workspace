The design will be broken down into subtasks for easier implementation.

    "description": "This RFC proposes the development of a comprehensive testing and quality assurance plan for the DarkMatterDetectorArray system. The testing will include unit tests, integration tests, system tests, and end-to-end tests. This plan will cover all components of the system, including edge cases, to ensure robustness and reliability. To improve efficiency and resilience, automation of testing where possible is suggested. \n\nFor each component (data processing, visualization, network communication), specific test strategies are proposed below: \n\n1. Data Processing: Test data for correctness, completeness, and timeliness. Use edge cases to ensure robustness against unexpected data. \n2. Visualization: Ensure accurate rendering of data in real-time, with focus on usability and performance optimization. \n3. Network Communication: Test network connectivity, message integrity, and latency across the global array of detectors. \n\nTo measure test coverage, a combination of code coverage metrics (e.g., line coverage, branch coverage) and functional test scenarios will be used. For tools or frameworks, we plan to use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for unit testing, [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) for end-to-end testing, and [Appveyor](https://www.appveyor.com/) for continuous integration. The estimated timeline is 8 weeks.\n\n**Review Comments:** This RFC should be assigned to the QA Tester for further development. Upon completion of the task, a technical report detailing the test results and any identified issues will be provided for review.\n",
