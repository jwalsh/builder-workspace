    "description": "Investigate the detailed technical requirements for the AI Tutoring Companion. Identify the target audience (corporate employees engaged in skill-building programs), learning domains (based on user needs, company objectives, and potential market trends), desired features (personalized learning paths, real-time feedback, adaptive difficulty levels, integration with existing HR systems, LMS platforms, and possibly collaboration tools such as Slack or Microsoft Teams). Consider potential future scalability, the need for data privacy and security, compliance with accessibility standards, and the potential impact of AI on user engagement and learning outcomes. Upon completion, prepare a comprehensive document detailing these findings, including performance benchmarks, edge cases, and potential challenges in implementation. Incorporate feedback from the project manager, frontend-developer, backend-developer, database-specialist, devops-engineer, qa-tester, security-specialist, and technical-writer. Upon approval, present the final document to the task-decomposer for further task decomposition. If necessary, suggest additional tasks or dependencies. Update the rfc_state field to 'APPROVED_FOR_IMPLEMENTATION' once approved. **Additional Recommendations:** Include a section on potential AI models and algorithms suitable for this project, such as machine learning techniques for skill recommendation and adaptive learning paths, and reinforcement learning for real-time feedback, as well as the possibility of integrating with popular collaboration tools like Slack or Microsoft Teams. **Update**: Suggested additional task: 'Explore the feasibility of using natural language processing (NLP) to enhance user interaction.'",
