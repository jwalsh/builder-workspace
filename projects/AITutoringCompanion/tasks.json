    "description": "Investigate the detailed technical requirements for the AI Tutoring Companion. Identify the target audience (corporate employees engaged in skill-building programs), learning domains (based on user needs, company objectives, and potential market trends), desired features (personalized learning paths, real-time feedback, adaptive difficulty levels, integration with existing HR systems, LMS platforms, and possibly collaboration tools). Consider potential future scalability, the need for data privacy and security, compliance with accessibility standards, and the potential impact of AI on user engagement and learning outcomes. Upon completion, prepare a comprehensive document detailing these findings, including performance benchmarks, edge cases, and potential challenges in implementation. Incorporate feedback from the project manager, frontend-developer, backend-developer, database-specialist, devops-engineer, qa-tester, security-specialist, and technical-writer. Upon approval, present the final document to the project manager for further task decomposition. If necessary, suggest additional tasks or dependencies. Update the rfc_state field to 'APPROVED_FOR_IMPLEMENTATION' once approved.\n\n**Additional Recommendations:** Include a section on potential AI models and algorithms suitable for this project. Consider the possibility of using machine learning techniques for skill recommendation and adaptive learning paths. Also, consider integrating with popular collaboration tools such as Slack or Microsoft Teams.",
