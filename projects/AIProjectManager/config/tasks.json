    "description": "Gather, document, and prioritize comprehensive requirements for the AIProjectManager, including desired features, integrations, target users, performance expectations, security considerations, scalability needs, user stories. Utilize stakeholder interviews, market research, and competitor analysis to identify gaps and opportunities. Collaborate with the team to refine these requirements throughout the development process. Focus on understanding the market demand, feasibility, and user experience in order to create an effective project management tool. Include a section for potential risks and mitigation strategies, as well as performance metrics and key success indicators (KPIs). Update the rfc_state field to 'READY_FOR_CODE_ARCHITECT_REVIEW' once completed. Prioritize usability and accessibility considerations throughout the requirements gathering process, and consider adding a section for potential technical debt estimation and strategies to manage it. Ensure that functional and non-functional requirements are well documented and clearly defined.",

Consider scalability, maintainability, performance requirements, security, and ease of deployment. Define the high-level components, their responsibilities, communication patterns, and data flows between them. Identify potential risks and mitigation strategies. Propose a technology stack that leverages microservices architecture for better scalability and maintainability, while ensuring seamless user experience, efficient data processing, and effective AI capabilities. The design should be modular, extensible, and adaptable to future updates or changes. Incorporate feedback from 'Define Project Scope and Requirements' task and ensure that the design addresses performance monitoring and logging for better system maintenance. Additionally, consider the use of containerization technologies for easier deployment and management. Update the RFC to include a focus on ensuring compliance with relevant data protection regulations and standards.",
