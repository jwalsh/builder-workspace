    "description": "Design the overall system architecture, including data ingestion, processing, storage, and analysis components. The architecture should consider scalability, fault tolerance, security best practices, and data governance. Identify the necessary components, their interactions, the technologies to be used, and the data flow between components. Also, outline the deployment strategy, infrastructure requirements, and implementation plan. This will involve selecting appropriate tools, defining APIs, creating database schemas, and configuring cloud services as needed. The architecture design should accommodate future growth, changes in technology, and regulatory compliance. Upon completion, the design document will be reviewed by the technical team and updated as necessary.",
