    "description": "Create a comprehensive document detailing the desired functionality of SynestheticSensoryEnhancer. The document should include user needs, system requirements, interface design, potential risks, ethical considerations, an overview of the necessary hardware and software components, their interfaces, and any relevant integration points. Additionally, provide a clear definition of the data flow and protocols to be used for communication between components, focusing on industry-standard protocols such as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) or WiFi Direct for wireless communication, and USB for wired connections. The document should also cover power management strategies, battery life optimization, and safety mechanisms. Include a section for testing and validation, outlining the test cases, test environments, and acceptance criteria.",
