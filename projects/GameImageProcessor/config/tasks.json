    "description": "Gather and document all project requirements for the GameImageProcessor, detailing input image formats (e.g., PNG, JPEG, GIF), desired transformations (e.g., resizing, cropping, watermarking), content moderation rules (e.g., nudity detection, violence detection, profanity filtering), storage options (e.g., cloud storage, CDN), integration with existing game systems (e.g., user authentication, game data management), non-functional requirements (e.g., scalability, performance, security), and guidelines for error handling and logging. Additionally, specify APIs for third-party services and outline the approach to manage changes in game requirements or updates to content moderation rules. Consider including edge cases for error handling and provide examples of logs that would be generated in various scenarios. This document should also cover performance benchmarks and capacity planning. Review and update this document as necessary throughout the project. If the document is complete, assign it to the task-decomposer for further breakdown into tasks.",
