Review and align with the System Architecture Design and User Requirements Gathering before implementation. Ensure data models are flexible enough to accommodate future updates or expansions of the platform, and ensure that they follow best practices for database design, such as using normalization and ensuring proper indexing for efficient queries. Once completed, review and provide feedback on the design with a focus on optimizing for performance and maintainability.",

The enhanced design should incorporate best practices for accessibility, responsiveness, usability across various devices and screen sizes. Optimize for performance and error handling, considering edge cases and scalability. Collaborate with User Research and Persona Development team to ensure user needs are met. Prioritize cross-browser compatibility, adhere to web standards, and consider internationalization aspects for a global audience. Consider feedback from the previous RFC 'System Architecture Design' while designing. Additionally, to maintain consistency with the branding and visual identity, collaborate closely with Graphic Design team. To ensure the design is scalable and can handle potential future features, liaise with the Code-Architect on the system architecture aspects.",
