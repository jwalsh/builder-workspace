Outline a comprehensive approach focusing on handling sensitive user data, outlining strategies for consent management, and addressing potential challenges related to data protection regulations. Suggest an initial high-level design that can serve as a starting point for the implementation phase, with emphasis on implementing a modular architecture approach to allow for easy integration of new features and third-party services. Include best practices for documentation throughout the project life cycle, focusing on areas like version control, collaboration tools, and clear documentation standards. \n\nUpon completion, suggest potential areas for further research or development that may arise during the design phase.\n\nUpdate the 'assigned_to' field to 'code-architect' to ensure clarity in task ownership.",

Incorporated user profiles, goals, tasks, progress tracking, performance metrics, and normalized tables for data consistency. Addressing data integrity, security, scalability, and maintainability in design. Considered edge cases, error handling, and performance optimizations. Aligned with the System Architecture Design and User Requirements Gathering before implementation. Designed database models to be flexible enough to accommodate future updates or expansions of the platform, adhering to best practices for database design, such as normalization and indexing for efficient queries. Implemented real-time data streaming for user activity tracking and machine learning algorithms for goal recommendations. Utilized NoSQL databases for semi-structured data storage like user profiles or goal descriptions. Suggest improvements for database queries, indexes, and caching strategies, including sharding strategies for scalability and data masking for security. Recommend optimizing the design further to enhance real-time performance, reduce latency, and ensure smooth operation of the platform.",

The enhanced design should incorporate best practices for accessibility, responsiveness, usability across various devices and screen sizes. Optimize for performance and error handling, considering edge cases and scalability. Collaborate with User Research and Persona Development team to ensure user needs are met. Prioritize cross-browser compatibility, adhere to web standards, and consider internationalization aspects for a global audience. Consider feedback from the previous RFC 'System Architecture Design' while designing. To maintain consistency with the branding and visual identity, collaborate closely with Graphic Design team. To ensure the design is scalable and can handle potential future features, liaise with the Code-Architect on the system architecture aspects and also involve Backend-Developer for server-side considerations. Ensure the design follows principles of progressive enhancement, ensuring functionality even when JavaScript is disabled. Update the UI/UX design to be mobile-first, focusing on a seamless experience across all devices. Include testing for accessibility standards such as WCAG 2.1 and ensure all controls are operable via keyboard. Upon completion, conduct usability testing with a diverse range of users to gather feedback for iterative improvements.",
