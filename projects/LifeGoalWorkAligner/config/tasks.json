Incorporated user profiles, goals, tasks, progress tracking, performance metrics, and normalized tables for data consistency. Addressing data integrity, security, scalability, and maintainability in design. Considered edge cases, error handling, and performance optimizations. Aligned with the System Architecture Design and User Requirements Gathering before implementation. Designed database models to be flexible enough to accommodate future updates or expansions of the platform, adhering to best practices for database design, such as normalization and indexing for efficient queries. Implemented real-time data streaming for user activity tracking and machine learning algorithms for goal recommendations. Utilized NoSQL databases for semi-structured data storage like user profiles or goal descriptions. Suggest improvements for database queries, indexes, and caching strategies, including sharding strategies for scalability and data masking for security. Recommend optimizing the design further to enhance real-time performance, reduce latency, and ensure smooth operation of the platform. Provide suggestions for query optimization, specifically focusing on reducing complexity, improving readability, and ensuring efficient execution of queries. Encourage exploration of column store databases like ClickHouse or Greenplum for handling large datasets related to user activity tracking and goal recommendations.",

The enhanced design should incorporate best practices for accessibility, responsiveness, usability across various devices and screen sizes. Optimize for performance and error handling, considering edge cases and scalability. Collaborate with User Research and Persona Development team to ensure user needs are met. Prioritize cross-browser compatibility, adhere to web standards, and consider internationalization aspects for a global audience. Consider feedback from the previous RFC 'System Architecture Design' while designing. To maintain consistency with the branding and visual identity, collaborate closely with Graphic Design team. To ensure the design is scalable and can handle potential future features, liaise with the Code-Architect on the system architecture aspects and also involve Backend-Developer for server-side considerations. Ensure the design follows principles of progressive enhancement, ensuring functionality even when JavaScript is disabled. Update the UI/UX design to be mobile-first, focusing on a seamless experience across all devices. Include testing for accessibility standards such as WCAG 2.1 and ensure all controls are operable via keyboard. Upon completion, conduct usability testing with a diverse range of users to gather feedback for iterative improvements.",
