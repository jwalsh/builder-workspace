    "description": "Gather and document the project requirements, define the scope, and identify the target users and use cases for the SecureCodeAnalyzer tool. Ensure to cover the following aspects:\n\n- Supported programming languages and frameworks (Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, etc.) with an emphasis on popular frameworks like React, Angular, Django, Express, Spring Boot, etc.\n- Integration with common IDEs and code editors (Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, Atom, etc.) and support for plugin development for others, including VS Code marketplace publishing\n- Real-time code analysis capabilities with options to pause/resume analysis as needed, and the ability to analyze entire projects or specific files\n- Vulnerability detection techniques (static analysis, dynamic analysis, taint analysis, etc.), including support for identifying security issues in third-party libraries and dependencies, and offering integration with tools like Black Duck\n- Secure coding best practices and recommendations based on OWASP Top Ten and SANS 25 Most Dangerous Software Errors, as well as industry-specific guidelines when applicable\n- Reporting and alerting mechanisms (email, Slack, API, etc.) with configurable severity levels, customizable notification preferences, and the ability to export reports in various formats (CSV, PDF, etc.)\n- User interface and experience requirements (intuitive design, clear feedback, customizable settings) focusing on usability for both developers and security teams, including accessibility according to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1)\n- Performance and scalability requirements (handling large codebases, low latency, efficient memory usage), including performance benchmarks and scalability testing plans with a focus on high concurrency scenarios\n- Deployment and maintenance considerations (cloud deployment options, version control, updates, security patches), with support for continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) workflows, containerization, and microservices architecture\n- Accessibility requirements according to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1) for web applications and user interfaces, as well as ensuring compatibility with assistive technologies such as screen readers\n- Documentation requirements (technical documentation, user guides, tutorials, and API documentation), including a public REST API and SDKs for popular languages\n- Testing and quality assurance (QA) considerations with a focus on code coverage, functional testing, security testing, and performance testing\n* Consider adding a section for threat modeling, vulnerability management, and penetration testing to identify potential threats and weaknesses in the system",
