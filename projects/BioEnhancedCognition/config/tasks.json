    "title": "Define Project Scope and Requirements - Revised",
    "description": "This task aims to gather, document, and validate functional and non-functional requirements for the BioEnhancedCognition device. The scope includes: \n1. Identifying target users (e.g., individuals with cognitive impairments or healthy adults seeking cognitive enhancement) \n2. Specifying desired cognitive enhancements (such as memory improvement, focus augmentation, and cognitive flexibility)\n3. Addressing safety considerations (like potential side effects, overstimulation risks, and user comfort)\n4. Ensuring regulatory compliance (FDA, CE, etc.)\n5. Securing data privacy (anonymization, encryption, and secure storage of sensitive user information)\n6. Enhancing user experience through an intuitive interface and effective feedback mechanisms\n7. Outlining integration with existing neurotechnology devices or apps\n8. Considering potential future expansion or upgrades\n9. Establishing the system's performance metrics and error handling mechanisms\n10. Assessing usability for people with disabilities\n11. Investigating compatibility with various operating systems\n12. Detailing the product lifecycle management strategy.\nUpon completion, the requirements will be reviewed by the project team before being handed over to development teams. It is advisable to create separate RFCs for each sub-task as follows: \n- Target User Profile (RFC 5930)\n- Desired Cognitive Enhancements (RFC 5931)\n- Safety and Comfort Considerations (RFC 5932)\n- Regulatory Compliance (RFC 5933)\n- Data Privacy Requirements (RFC 5934)\n- User Experience Improvements (RFC 5935)\n- Integration with Existing Neurotechnology (RFC 5936)\n- Future Expansion and Upgrade Planning (RFC 5937)\n- Performance Metrics and Error Handling Mechanisms (RFC 5938)\n- Accessibility and Usability for Disabled Users (RFC 5939)\n- Compatibility with Operating Systems (RFC 5940)\n- Product Lifecycle Management Strategy (RFC 5941).\nThe project manager should decompose this RFC into the suggested sub-tasks, assign them to relevant team members as necessary and update the dependencies accordingly. Upon completion of each sub-task, they can be reviewed and approved before being handed over to development teams.\nUpdate: The rfc_state field should be updated to 'NEEDS_DECOMPOSITION'.",
