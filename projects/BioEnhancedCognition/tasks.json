    "description": "This task aims to gather, document, and validate functional and non-functional requirements for the BioEnhancedCognition device. This includes identifying target users (e.g., individuals with cognitive impairments or healthy adults seeking cognitive enhancement), specifying desired cognitive enhancements (such as memory improvement, focus augmentation, and cognitive flexibility), addressing safety considerations (like potential side effects, overstimulation risks, and user comfort), ensuring regulatory compliance (FDA, CE, etc.), securing data privacy (anonymization, encryption, and secure storage of sensitive user information), enhancing user experience through an intuitive interface and effective feedback mechanisms, outlining integration with existing neurotechnology devices or apps, considering potential future expansion or upgrades, establishing the system's performance metrics and error handling mechanisms, assessing usability for people with disabilities, investigating compatibility with various operating systems, and detailing the product lifecycle management strategy. Upon completion, the requirements will be reviewed by the project team before being handed over to development teams. It is recommended to break down this task into smaller sub-tasks for efficient execution.",
