    "description": "Design the overall system architecture for the AdFlow platform, including components, data flow, integration points, and key considerations for scalability, maintainability, and security. The architecture should address functional areas: campaign management, content item approval, user management, and campaign auditing; also, ensure adherence to best practices in software design and development. This task builds upon 'Project Planning and Requirements Gathering'. Additionally, consider the use of microservices architecture for better scalability and maintainability, and include a detailed security plan with encryption strategies and access controls. The RFC is ready for review by the project manager or technical lead. This RFC also emphasizes the importance of ensuring modularity, testability, and maintainability throughout the design process. Upon approval, this RFC will be passed to the 'task-decomposer' for further task decomposition.",
