# RFC 519: Database Design - Review Needed

**Project:** AdFlow
**Status:** IN PROGRESS (Revised)
**Assigned to:** database-specialist
**Priority:** 3
**Dependencies:** System Architecture Design
**Task Type:** RFC
**RFC State:** REVIEW_NEEDED

## Description

This RFC outlines the database design for the AdFlow project, encompassing schema design, data modeling, performance optimizations, technology selection, security considerations, and disaster recovery strategies. The design aims to ensure efficient querying, data integrity, scalability, and high availability.

## Key Points

* **Database Schema and Data Models:** The schema will store campaign, content, user, and audit data. Relationships between entities and potential data access patterns (read-heavy and write-heavy) need to be defined.
* **Performance Optimizations:** Indexing, normalization, partitioning strategies, and denormalization techniques will be considered to enhance performance in complex query scenarios.
* **Database Technology:** Recommendations for database technology (relational, NoSQL, or hybrid) will be provided, justifying the choice based on project requirements, scalability needs, and expected data volumes.
* **Security:** Data encryption, access controls, auditing mechanisms, and data masking for sensitive user information will be incorporated.
* **Disaster Recovery:** Backup, replication, and high availability strategies will be defined to ensure resilience against data loss.
* **Transactional Consistency:** Solutions for implementing transactional consistency in multi-region deployments or eventual consistency models to improve read performance will be researched and recommended.

## Review Needed

This RFC requires another review before implementation. Specific areas that may need further discussion or clarification include:

* **Data Access Patterns:** A more detailed analysis of expected data access patterns is needed to inform indexing and partitioning strategies.
* **Hybrid Database Approach:** If a hybrid approach is recommended, the specific use cases for each database technology should be clearly defined.
* **Transactional Consistency:** The trade-offs between different consistency models (transactional vs. eventual) should be evaluated in the context of AdFlow's requirements.
* **Security:** A comprehensive security review should be conducted to ensure that all sensitive data is adequately protected.

## Next Steps

1. **Address Review Comments:** The database-specialist should review and address the comments from the previous review.
2. **Conduct Further Analysis:** Additional analysis may be needed in the areas mentioned above.
3. **Resubmit for Review:** Once the RFC has been revised, it should be resubmitted for review.

## Important Note

The successful implementation of this RFC is critical for the AdFlow project. A well-designed database will ensure that the system can handle the expected data volumes, provide efficient access to data, and maintain data integrity and security.
