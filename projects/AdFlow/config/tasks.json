    "title": "System Architecture Design for AdFlow Platform (Updated)",
    "description": "Update the overall system architecture design for the AdFlow platform, focusing on components, data flow, integration points, and key considerations for scalability, maintainability, and security. The updated architecture should address functional areas: campaign management, content item approval, user management, and campaign auditing; also, ensure adherence to best practices in software design and development.\n\nTo improve clarity and facilitate task decomposition, break down the functional areas (campaign management, content item approval, user management, and campaign auditing) into more specific subtasks:\n\n1. Campaign Management Sub-Task: Design the architecture for creating, editing, tracking, and analyzing campaigns.\n2. Content Item Approval Sub-Task: Design the architecture for approving/rejecting advertising content.\n3. User Management Sub-Task: Design the architecture for managing user accounts and permissions.\n4. Campaign Auditing Sub-Task: Design the architecture for reviewing and auditing campaign performance data.\n\nAdditionally, consider the use of microservices architecture for better scalability and maintainability, and include a detailed security plan with encryption strategies and access controls. This RFC emphasizes the importance of ensuring modularity, testability, and maintainability throughout the design process. The RFC is ready for review by the project manager or technical lead.\n\nUpon approval, this RFC will be passed to the 'task-decomposer' for further task decomposition.\n\nSuggested Changes:\n- Provide more details about microservices architecture, such as service boundaries and communication mechanisms (e.g., gRPC, REST APIs). Clarify how services will communicate with each other and with the frontend/backend.\n- Clearly define the data flow between services, databases, and external systems like third-party analytics tools.\n- Include design patterns that can help with maintainability, scalability, and testability (e.g., SOLID principles, circuit breakers).\n- Add a section for monitoring and logging strategies (e.g., ELK Stack, Prometheus, Splunk).\n- Consider implementing a CI/CD pipeline to automate deployment and testing.\n- Provide guidelines for error handling and exception management.\n- Mention the importance of implementing an API gateway and rate limiting for ensuring proper resource usage.\n- Include details about data persistence strategy and consider event sourcing and command query responsibility segregation (CQRS) for better scalability and consistency.\n\nIf the RFC is approved in its current state, update the 'rfc_state' field to 'APPROVED_FOR_DECOMPOSITION'.",

    "description": "Design the database schema and data models for storing campaign, content, user, and audit data. Ensure the schema supports efficient querying, data integrity, and scalability. Consider indexing, normalization, partitioning strategies for optimized performance. Define relationships between entities and data access patterns. Provide recommendations for database technology (e.g., relational, NoSQL) based on project requirements such as performance, scalability, and security. Justify the choice of database technology by comparing its pros and cons with other alternatives like relational databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL), NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra), and cloud-based solutions (e.g., AWS DynamoDB, Google Cloud Spanner). Incorporate guidelines for data backup, recovery, and replication strategies to ensure high availability and disaster recovery. Address security considerations like data encryption, access controls, and auditing mechanisms. Provide a high-level diagram illustrating the data architecture, including key entities and their relationships. Ensure that the design is flexible enough to accommodate future enhancements and expansions of AdFlow. The design should also take into account potential performance bottlenecks and scalability issues. In addition, consider implementing caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data and sharding strategies for horizontal scalability. Also, discuss the choice of database technology in terms of its ability to handle concurrent read and write operations efficiently.",
