    "description": "This RFC aims to clearly outline the legal documents to be generated by the LegalDocumentGenerator system. The system should support user inputs, jurisdictional requirements (including specific countries/states), document formats, and additional features such as multi-language support, document proofreading, and integration with popular law practice management systems. Detailed examples of user inputs for each type of document are required. For this RFC, provide a comprehensive list of all possible legal documents that can be generated along with the corresponding jurisdictional requirements. Additionally, identify potential edge cases or exceptions that may arise during generation.\n\n**Examples of User Inputs:**\n- For a non-disclosure agreement: company name, parties involved, duration, and any specific clauses.\n- For a sales contract: product/service details, price, payment terms, delivery schedule, warranty information, etc.\n\n**Possible Legal Documents:**\n1. Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs)\n   - Jurisdictional Requirements: Worldwide\n2. Sales Contracts\n   - Jurisdictional Requirements: United States, United Kingdom, European Union countries\n3. Lease Agreements\n   - Jurisdictional Requirements: United States (varies by state)\n4. Employment Contracts\n   - Jurisdictional Requirements: United States, United Kingdom, European Union countries\n5. Patent Applications\n   - Jurisdictional Requirements: Worldwide (specific to patent office)\n6. Trademark Registrations\n   - Jurisdictional Requirements: Worldwide (specific to trademark office)\n7. Licensing Agreements\n   - Jurisdictional Requirements: Worldwide",
