    "description": "This RFC aims to clearly outline the legal documents to be generated by the LegalDocumentGenerator system. The system should support user inputs, jurisdictional requirements (including specific countries/states), document formats, and additional features such as multi-language support, document proofreading, and integration with popular law practice management systems. Detailed examples of user inputs for each type of document are required. For this RFC, provide a comprehensive list of all possible legal documents that can be generated along with the corresponding jurisdictional requirements. Additionally, identify potential edge cases or exceptions that may arise during generation. The list provided includes both common and some less-common legal documents. However, it's essential to consider less frequent document types that might still be necessary for specific use cases. For example, consider the inclusion of shareholder agreements, partnership agreements, and settlement agreements in the list.\n\n**Examples of User Inputs:**\n- For a non-disclosure agreement: company name, parties involved, duration, and any specific clauses.\n- For a sales contract: product/service details, price, payment terms, delivery schedule, warranty information, etc.\n\n**Possible Legal Documents:**\n1. Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs)\n   - Jurisdictional Requirements: Worldwide\n2. Sales Contracts\n   - Jurisdictional Requirements: United States, United Kingdom, European Union countries, India, China, Australia\n3. Lease Agreements\n   - Jurisdictional Requirements: United States (varies by state), United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Germany\n4. Employment Contracts\n   - Jurisdictional Requirements: United States, United Kingdom, European Union countries, India, China, Australia, South Africa\n5. Patent Applications\n   - Jurisdictional Requirements: Worldwide (specific to patent office)\n6. Trademark Registrations\n   - Jurisdictional Requirements: Worldwide (specific to trademark office)\n7. Licensing Agreements\n   - Jurisdictional Requirements: Worldwide\n8. Franchise Agreements\n   - Jurisdictional Requirements: United States, India, Canada, France, Germany\n9. Power of Attorney Documents\n   - Jurisdictional Requirements: Worldwide (specific to jurisdiction)\n10. Will and Trust Documents\n   - Jurisdictional Requirements: United States, United Kingdom, Australia, India\n11. Shareholder Agreements\n   - Jurisdictional Requirements: Worldwide (specific to jurisdiction)\n12. Partnership Agreements\n   - Jurisdictional Requirements: Worldwide (specific to jurisdiction)\n13. Settlement Agreements\n   - Jurisdictional Requirements: Worldwide (specific to jurisdiction)\n**Potential Edge Cases:**\n- Jurisdiction-specific clauses or requirements not accounted for in the user input system.\n- Inconsistencies between user inputs and jurisdictional requirements.",
