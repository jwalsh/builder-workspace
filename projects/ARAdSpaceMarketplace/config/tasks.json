Focus on scalability, security, performance, and maintainability. Define communication protocols and data formats for external system integration. Identify potential bottlenecks and propose solutions. Ensure multi-tenancy is supported, allowing multiple businesses to use the platform concurrently. Incorporate a content management system (CMS) for managing advertising content and metadata. Plan for data analytics and reporting capabilities to provide valuable insights to businesses and advertisers. Additionally, consider implementing caching strategies to optimize performance. For backend development, consider microservices architecture for better scalability and maintainability. For frontend development, ensure compatibility with a variety of AR devices and support cross-platform development. Lastly, specify APIs for third-party integrations.",
