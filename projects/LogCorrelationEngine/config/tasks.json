Consider scalability, security, and performance for large-scale log data processing. To ensure a robust design, explore distributed systems, machine learning, and real-time processing capabilities. In addition, outline strategies for handling various data types (structured and unstructured), ensuring privacy, and maintaining system efficiency. To achieve an effective design, collaborate with relevant team members such as data scientists, security experts, system administrators, and frontend/backend developers during the design process.\n\nFor the design to be approved, incorporate feedback from code-architect, project-manager, and security-specialist in the next draft. Once feedback is addressed, update the rfc_state field to 'APPROVED'.",
