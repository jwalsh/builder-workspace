    "description": "Gather and document comprehensive requirements for the QuantumStateInspector system. These should include: \n\n- Specific quantum computer models and architectures supported (e.g., superconducting qubits, trapped ions, topological qubits).\n- Types of quantum state information to be observed and analyzed (density matrices, wave functions, coherence times, gate fidelities, and potential future data from emerging trends like quantum supremacy).\n- Desired user interface and reporting capabilities (real-time visualization, customizable dashboards, export options) with an emphasis on usability and intuitive design.\n- Performance, scalability, security, and maintainability requirements that consider the unique challenges of quantum computing.\n- Consideration of emerging trends in quantum computing and their potential impact on the system's design and functionality.\n- Clear, concise, and organized documentation of the requirements for easy access by the entire development team.\n- Implementation of a version control system (e.g., Git) to manage updates and provide a transparent history of changes.\n\nLastly, ensure that the requirements are reviewed and updated regularly to reflect the latest developments in quantum computing technology.",
