    "description": "Revised document detailing the ThreatSimulationEngine's requirements. This revision includes clarification on the types of cyber threats to be simulated (e.g., phishing, malware, DDoS attacks), the testing scenarios, desired outputs (including real-time analytics and reporting mechanisms), performance expectations (processing power, response times, etc.), and potential integration with existing security systems. Additionally, it outlines the need for modularity to accommodate future threat types and updates. The document also includes a section on user roles and permissions, and an improved explanation of the system's functionalities, focusing on its ability to simulate complex and realistic cyber threats. It further discusses the importance of ensuring data privacy and security within the system. Finally, it suggests the need for regular updates and improvements based on feedback from users and changing threat landscapes. The document is now ready for review and approval. Please find attached the revised document.",
