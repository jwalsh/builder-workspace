    "description": "Design the overall architecture of the MetricStreamProcessor system, including components, data flow, and integration points. Consider the following aspects: 1) Data ingestion layer for handling high-volume metric data streams (consider Kafka or similar for real-time processing), 2) Data processing layer for real-time analysis and transformation (include Spark Streaming or Flink for fast data processing, but also consider Apache Beam as an alternative, and investigate if using Delta Lake with Databricks could provide better performance for large datasets), 3) Data storage layer for persisting processed data (use distributed databases like Cassandra or Bigtable for scalability, but also evaluate Google Cloud Spanner for its ACID compliance and horizontal scalability, and consider using Google's BigQuery for batch processing tasks), 4) Scalability and load balancing mechanisms (consider Apache Hadoop YARN for resource management, but also investigate Kubernetes and AWS ECS/EKS for container orchestration, and explore serverless options like AWS Lambda where applicable), 5) Monitoring and alerting components (use Prometheus for monitoring and Grafana for visualization, but consider adding Telegraf for plugins support and elasticsearch for log analysis), 6) Security and access control (implement OAuth2 or similar for secure authentication and authorization, but also ensure encryption at rest and in transit using tools like Vault or Keycloak, and investigate if multi-factor authentication could enhance security), 7) Fault tolerance and high availability (replicate data across multiple regions for redundancy, but also consider using distributed systems like Apache Zookeeper or etcd for service discovery, and explore the use of containerization for microservices architecture to improve fault tolerance), 8) Provide detailed documentation for each component and its interaction with others (utilize a tool like Sphinx for generating API documentation from source code comments, but also consider using Doxygen for C++ code). Update the architecture design as necessary based on team discussions and technological advancements. Once the design is finalized, create a separate RFC for implementation. Assign the task to 'project-manager' for further discussion.",

This task will be broken down into subtasks such as: Design Real-Time Data Visualization, Implement Customizable Dashboards, Create Alerting Mechanisms, Develop User Management System, and Design Interface Adaptability. In addition, it is recommended to include the following features: support for data export (in various formats), real-time collaboration tools (e.g., chat functionality), and a search function that allows users to quickly find specific metrics or trends within their dashboards. This approach will facilitate clearer communication and smoother progression through development. After incorporating these suggestions, this RFC is ready for the next state.",
