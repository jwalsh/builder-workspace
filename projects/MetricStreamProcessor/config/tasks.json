Consider the following aspects: 1) Data ingestion layer for handling high-volume metric data streams (consider Kafka or similar for real-time processing), 2) Data processing layer for real-time analysis and transformation (include Spark Streaming or Flink for fast data processing), 3) Data storage layer for persisting processed data (use distributed databases like Cassandra or Bigtable for scalability), 4) Scalability and load balancing mechanisms (consider Apache Hadoop YARN for resource management), 5) Monitoring and alerting components (use Prometheus for monitoring and Grafana for visualization), 6) Security and access control (implement OAuth2 or similar for secure authentication and authorization), 7) Fault tolerance and high availability (replicate data across multiple regions for redundancy), 8) Provide detailed documentation for each component and its interaction with others.",
