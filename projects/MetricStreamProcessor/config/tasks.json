    "description": "Design the overall architecture of the MetricStreamProcessor system, including components, data flow, and integration points. Consider the following aspects: 1) Data ingestion layer for handling high-volume metric data streams (consider Kafka or similar for real-time processing), 2) Data processing layer for real-time analysis and transformation (include Spark Streaming or Flink for fast data processing, but also consider Apache Beam as an alternative), 3) Data storage layer for persisting processed data (use distributed databases like Cassandra or Bigtable for scalability, but also evaluate Google Cloud Spanner for its ACID compliance and horizontal scalability), 4) Scalability and load balancing mechanisms (consider Apache Hadoop YARN for resource management, but also investigate Kubernetes and AWS ECS/EKS for container orchestration), 5) Monitoring and alerting components (use Prometheus for monitoring and Grafana for visualization, but consider adding Telegraf for plugins support), 6) Security and access control (implement OAuth2 or similar for secure authentication and authorization, but also ensure encryption at rest and in transit using tools like Vault or Keycloak), 7) Fault tolerance and high availability (replicate data across multiple regions for redundancy, but also consider using distributed systems like Apache Zookeeper or etcd for service discovery), 8) Provide detailed documentation for each component and its interaction with others (utilize a tool like Sphinx for generating API documentation from source code comments). Update the architecture design as necessary based on team discussions and technological advancements. Once the design is finalized, create a separate RFC for implementation.",
