    "description": "Design the overall architecture of the MetricStreamProcessor system, including components, data flow, and integration points. Consider the following aspects: 1) Data ingestion layer for handling high-volume metric data streams (consider Kafka or similar for real-time processing), 2) Data processing layer for real-time analysis and transformation (include Spark Streaming or Flink for fast data processing, also consider Apache Beam as an alternative. Investigate if using Delta Lake with Databricks could provide better performance for large datasets), 3) Data storage layer for persisting processed data (use distributed databases like Cassandra or Bigtable for scalability, evaluate Google Cloud Spanner for its ACID compliance and horizontal scalability, consider using Google's BigQuery for batch processing tasks, and explore the use of Amazon DynamoDB for its high performance), 4) Scalability and load balancing mechanisms (consider Apache Hadoop YARN for resource management, investigate Kubernetes and AWS ECS/EKS for container orchestration, also explore serverless options like AWS Lambda where applicable, and consider using AWS AppRunner as a new serverless option), 5) Monitoring and alerting components (use Prometheus for monitoring and Grafana for visualization, consider adding Telegraf for plugins support and elasticsearch for log analysis, investigate if Grafana Cloud could enhance capabilities), 6) Security and access control (implement OAuth2 or similar for secure authentication and authorization, ensure encryption at rest and in transit using tools like Vault or Keycloak, investigate if multi-factor authentication and Zero Trust Architecture could enhance security), 7) Fault tolerance and high availability (replicate data across multiple regions for redundancy, consider using distributed systems like Apache Zookeeper or etcd for service discovery, explore the use of containerization for microservices architecture to improve fault tolerance, also investigate if Kubernetes federation could be beneficial), 8) Provide detailed documentation for each component and its interaction with others (utilize a tool like Sphinx for generating API documentation from source code comments, but also consider using Doxygen for C++ code, and ensure that the documentation is accessible and easy to understand). Update the architecture design as necessary based on team discussions and technological advancements. Once the design is finalized, create a separate RFC for implementation. Assign the task to 'task-decomposer' for further discussion.",

The revised design should focus on further optimizing the engine for low latency, high throughput, and fault tolerance to handle large volumes of data in real-time. To achieve this, consider implementing a microservices architecture using modern programming languages (e.g., Go, Rust). This updated design should also take into account the integration with existing components like the ingestion layer and storage system, ensuring seamless data flow between them. Implement mechanisms to monitor and manage resource usage for improved performance and cost-efficiency, such as auto-scaling and resource pooling. Consider implementing distributed consensus algorithms for fault tolerance, and use message queues for decoupling components and improving throughput. To improve maintainability, consider adopting a modular design that allows for easy replacement of individual components. Provide a detailed plan for the implementation, including an estimated timeline and potential challenges, such as ensuring compatibility with existing systems and managing data consistency across distributed services.

Key features include: real-time data visualization with dynamic updates, customizable dashboards that allow users to create their own views, alerting mechanisms with adjustable thresholds and notification preferences, a user management system that handles authentication, authorization, and roles, an intuitive and responsive design that adapts to various devices and screen sizes. Additionally, consider incorporating support for data export in various formats, real-time collaboration tools (e.g., chat functionality), and a search function that allows users to quickly find specific metrics or trends within their dashboards. This approach will facilitate clearer communication and smoother progression through development. After incorporating these suggestions, this RFC is ready for the next state. For further improvement, consider enhancing data visualization by implementing advanced analytics capabilities (e.g., trend analysis, correlation analysis), improving the responsiveness of the interface with efficient loading times and smooth transitions, and ensuring accessibility compliance for all users. This task will be broken down into subtasks such as: Design Real-Time Data Visualization, Implement Customizable Dashboards, Create Alerting Mechanisms, Develop User Management System, Design Interface Adaptability, Enhance Data Visualization, Improve Responsiveness, and Ensure Accessibility Compliance.
