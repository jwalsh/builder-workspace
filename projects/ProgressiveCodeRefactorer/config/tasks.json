    "description": "This RFC aims to gather and document the functional and non-functional requirements for the ProgressiveCodeRefactorer tool. The target audience includes developers of various levels, with support for multiple programming languages (Java, Python, JavaScript, C#, Go, Swift, Ruby). The refactoring challenges to be included are expected to range from basic tasks like variable renaming and method extraction to advanced topics such as code consolidation, design pattern implementation, and best practices in code organization. Additionally, the incorporation of gamification elements is proposed for a more engaging user experience.\n\nTo ensure comprehensive coverage, it would be beneficial to involve a diverse team during the requirements gathering process, including frontend-developer, backend-developer, database-specialist, devops-engineer, QA tester, security-specialist, and technical-writer. Furthermore, it is crucial to establish clear guidelines on how each refactoring challenge will be assessed and scored to motivate users effectively.\n\nIn order to facilitate efficient task decomposition, we recommend breaking down the project into smaller tasks, addressing different aspects of the tool such as frontend/backend development, gamification, documentation, etc. This will enable us to assign each task to a dedicated team member or role.\n\nUpon completion of this RFC, it is expected that a comprehensive list of requirements will be available, guiding the development process for the ProgressiveCodeRefactorer tool.",

    "description": "Design the overall system architecture, including the user interface, backend components, data storage solutions (considering scalability, performance, security, and maintainability), and integration with external services (if any). The design should be modular, allowing for easy addition of new refactoring challenges. It's essential to consider accessibility for different user skill levels. Define the high-level components, their responsibilities, and the communication flow between them. This design will serve as a foundation for task decomposition. Here are some suggestions on how to optimize the architecture for diverse user skill levels: \n1. Progressive learning: Allow users to start with simple refactoring challenges and gradually introduce more complex ones based on their progress.\n2. Real-time feedback: Provide immediate feedback on the correctness of the solutions, helping users learn from their mistakes. \n3. Interactive tutorials: Include interactive tutorials for each challenge, explaining best practices and design patterns in an engaging way.\n4. Adaptive difficulty: Adjust the difficulty level of challenges dynamically based on user performance.\n5. Collaboration features: Enable users to collaborate with each other, sharing solutions and learning from one another. If necessary, update the dependencies to include 'Design user interface' and 'Define progressive learning strategy'. Once the design is finalized, update the rfc_state field to 'READY_FOR_IMPLEMENTATION' and assign it to a suitable team for implementation.",

Integration Testing:\n   - Modules are combined and tested as groups.\n   - Tests will verify the interactions between the different modules, focusing on edge cases and potential integration issues.\n\n3. System Testing:\n   - End-to-end testing of the entire system.\n   - Tests will ensure that all components function together seamlessly and perform under expected load conditions.\n\n4. User Acceptance Testing:\n   - Real users interact with the tool and provide feedback.\n   - This will help identify any usability issues or areas for improvement, and will validate that the tool effectively teaches best practices in code organization and design patterns.\n",

This encompasses, but is not limited to: encryption, access controls, user authentication, secure coding practices, and regular security updates.\n\n**Key aspects:**\n1. Data Encryption: Implement end-to-end encryption for user data at rest and in transit using modern encryption algorithms such as AES-256.\n2. Access Controls: Establish role-based access controls for users and administrators, with a clear separation of duties.\n3. User Authentication: Implement secure authentication methods, such as OAuth or JWT, and enable multi-factor authentication to further enhance security.\n4. Secure Coding Practices: Adhere to the OWASP Top 10 guidelines, perform regular code reviews using tools like SonarQube or CodeClimate, and follow secure coding best practices such as input validation and proper error handling.\n5. Regular Security Updates: Ensure the application is updated regularly with the latest security patches and stay informed about new vulnerabilities and threats.\n\n**Additional Suggestions:**\n- Consider implementing a monitoring system to detect potential threats or breaches in real-time.\n- Provide clear documentation for each security measure implemented, including implementation details and maintenance procedures.",
