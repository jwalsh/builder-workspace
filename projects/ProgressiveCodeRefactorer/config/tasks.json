    "description": "This RFC aims to gather and document the functional and non-functional requirements for the ProgressiveCodeRefactorer tool. The target audience includes developers of various levels, with support for multiple programming languages (Java, Python, JavaScript, C#, Go, Swift, Ruby). The refactoring challenges to be included are expected to range from basic tasks like variable renaming and method extraction to advanced topics such as code consolidation, design pattern implementation, and best practices in code organization. Furthermore, the incorporation of gamification elements is proposed for a more engaging user experience. \n\nTo ensure comprehensive coverage, it would be beneficial to engage a diverse team during the requirements gathering process, including frontend-developer, backend-developer, database-specialist, devops-engineer, qa-tester, security-specialist, and technical-writer.",

The design should be modular, allowing for easy addition of new refactoring challenges. Also consider accessibility for different user skill levels. Define the high-level components, their responsibilities, and the communication flow between them. This design will serve as a foundation for task decomposition. Please provide suggestions on how to optimize the architecture for diverse user skill levels.",

Unit Testing:\n   - Individual units or modules of the codebase are tested.\n   - Test cases will be designed based on each function and method in the codebase.\n   - Test data will be carefully crafted to ensure comprehensive coverage.\n\n2. Integration Testing:\n   - Modules are combined and tested as groups.\n   - Tests will verify the interactions between the different modules.\n\n3. System Testing:\n   - End-to-end testing of the entire system.\n   - Tests will ensure that all components function together seamlessly.\n\n4. User Acceptance Testing:\n   - Real users interact with the tool and provide feedback.\n   - This will help identify any usability issues or areas for improvement.\n",

Data Encryption: Implement end-to-end encryption for user data at rest and in transit.\n2. Access Controls: Establish role-based access controls for users and administrators.\n3. User Authentication: Implement secure authentication methods, such as OAuth or JWT.\n4. Secure Coding Practices: Adhere to the OWASP Top 10 guidelines and perform regular code reviews.\n5. Regular Security Updates: Ensure the application is updated regularly with the latest security patches.",
