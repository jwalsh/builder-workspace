    "description": "Gather and document detailed requirements for the AI Construction Planner system, including stakeholder needs, project constraints, expected functionalities (with specific use cases), performance requirements (e.g., response time, throughput), scalability requirements (e.g., handling large datasets, managing multiple projects concurrently), security requirements (e.g., data privacy, access control, potential threats and mitigation strategies), maintainability requirements, and integration with existing construction management systems. Engage relevant stakeholders (construction managers, project planners, resource managers) to capture their specific needs, constraints, and preferences. Document any potential challenges or limitations that may impact the project's success, and propose possible solutions or workarounds. If necessary, collaborate with the technical writer to create a comprehensive documentation of the system requirements.",
