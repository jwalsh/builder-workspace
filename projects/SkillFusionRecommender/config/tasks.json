The design should also detail how AI algorithms will be integrated for skill recommendation. Provide a clear breakdown of the system's architecture, including frontend, backend, database, and AI components, with an emphasis on separating concerns between these layers and maintaining loose coupling where possible. Consider utilizing microservices architecture to promote scalability, modularity, and maintainability. Include a detailed description of data storage strategies for skill data, user data, and recommendation results, including any necessary indexing or caching strategies. Address potential security concerns such as data privacy, authentication, and authorization.",
