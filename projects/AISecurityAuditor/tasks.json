    "description": "Revised and expanded detailed requirements for the AISecurityAuditor project. The scope includes the detection of various security vulnerabilities (e.g., code vulnerabilities, misconfigured infrastructure, outdated dependencies, unpatched software, insecure data handling, insufficient access controls), across multiple environments (source code repositories, cloud infrastructure, containerized environments, network devices, databases). The desired output formats for vulnerability reports include human-readable reports, machine-readable formats for integration with other tools, API endpoints for real-time alerts. Integration points with existing security tools and processes are to be established (e.g., CI/CD pipelines, issue tracking systems, notification mechanisms, incident response workflows). The AI system's recommendations will cover suggesting remediation strategies and providing contextual guidance for developers. This task remains in progress and is assigned to the code-architect.",
