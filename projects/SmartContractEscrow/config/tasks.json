Consider potential use of sidechains, sharding, and off-chain computations for improved efficiency. Provide detailed diagrams or documentation to aid in understanding the proposed architecture. In addition, explore the possibility of implementing a modular design approach, allowing for easy upgrades and extensions, and discuss the pros and cons of using different consensus mechanisms. If possible, provide examples of similar systems that have been successfully implemented.",
