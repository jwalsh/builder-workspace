    "description": "Detailed requirements gathering for the SmartContractAuditor tool:\n1. Supported blockchain platforms (e.g., Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric, EOS, Binance Smart Chain, Tron, Polkadot, Solana, etc.).\n2. Identification of a wide range of potential vulnerabilities (e.g., re-entrancy, integer overflows, time manipulation, race conditions, gas-related issues, security misconfigurations, and smart contract design flaws).\n3. Desired output format for the audit results (JSON, HTML, or a custom format, with an emphasis on making the results easily readable and actionable by developers, considering the need for integrations with popular IDEs and development tools).\n4. Additional functionality such as suggestions for improvements, explanations of the identified vulnerabilities, and guidance on how to mitigate them.\n5. Implementation of user-friendly interface and robust reporting features for efficient collaboration between developers and auditors.\n6. Integration with popular blockchain development tools (Truffle, Remix, etc.) for seamless use.\n7. Performance testing and optimization to ensure the tool can handle large-scale smart contracts.",
