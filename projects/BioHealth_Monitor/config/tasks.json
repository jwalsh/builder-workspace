The task is currently under progress by the code-architect. Dependency on 'System Architecture Design' has been met. Once completed, it will be handed over to the security-specialist for final review before deployment. The updated task description now includes specific security measures, implementation milestones, and a timeline for each milestone to facilitate better tracking. Upon completion, the task will be assigned to the security-specialist for final review and deployment. It is recommended to add a timeline for each milestone for better tracking.",

Define clear steps for the initial deployment of the system in various environments (development, testing, staging, production). This should include the specific tools and technologies to be used at each stage, as well as the rationale behind these choices.\n2. Outline a monitoring strategy that includes alerting mechanisms and performance metrics to ensure optimal system operation, with an emphasis on incorporating real-time analytics for continuous improvement and setting clear thresholds for each metric.\n3. Describe maintenance procedures, including backup strategies, patch management, and troubleshooting guidelines. This should also include a plan for regular system health checks to proactively identify and address potential issues, as well as a system for logging and tracking these issues for future reference.\n4. Detail disaster recovery procedures in case of system failure or data loss, with specific focus on implementing redundancy and failover mechanisms to minimize downtime and ensure data integrity, and outlining a plan for regular disaster recovery drills and tests.\n5. Define an update/upgrade process that minimizes downtime and ensures data integrity, while also providing a plan for testing the updates before deployment in the production environment, including a regression testing strategy.\n6. Provide comprehensive documentation for all aspects of the strategy, including clear instructions for each step, potential troubleshooting tips, and examples where appropriate.\n\nPlease note that this strategy will be reviewed and updated periodically to reflect any changes in technology, compliance requirements, or user feedback. The strategy should also be designed with future scalability in mind.\n\nAssigned To: technical-writer",
