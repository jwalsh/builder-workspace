This includes identifying features, functionalities, target audience, technical constraints, security considerations, compliance requirements, integration with existing systems or third-party services (including APIs), scalability and performance requirements, and potential user experience design aspects. Additionally, provide a clear breakdown of tasks based on roles such as frontend development, backend development, database management, DevOps, QA testing, and security considerations for each task. Clearly outline the project's goals, objectives, timelines, and budget. Include research into market trends and competitor analysis to ensure our solution stands out. For the RFC state, update as 'IN_PROGRESS' once started. The tasks will be decomposed by the assigned role and assigned accordingly after this RFC is approved.",

    "description": "Design the overall architecture of the APIFortress solution, incorporating a modular approach for easy extensibility and maintenance. The design should follow best practices for microservices architecture, adhere to modern DevOps methodologies (such as CI/CD pipelines), and ensure compatibility with the latest industry standards (OAS 3.0, OpenAPI). The design should also cover aspects of observability, monitoring, and logging. Consider using containerization technologies such as Docker for deployment and Kubernetes for orchestration, and include a plan for container orchestration using tools like Helm or ArgoCD. Upon completion, conduct a thorough review and documentation of the design before handing it over to the task-decomposer. The design should consider scalability, security, performance, high availability, edge cases, error handling, and performance optimizations. Additionally, include a plan for testing strategies to validate the proposed design. Lastly, add the following dependencies: API Design, Security Requirements Gathering, Performance Requirements Gathering, API Specification (OAS 3.0), Cloud Infrastructure Best Practices, Microservices Architecture Best Practices, CI/CD Pipeline Best Practices, and Modern Observability, Monitoring, and Logging Strategies. Upon review, update the architecture design with any necessary revisions based on feedback before moving forward.",
