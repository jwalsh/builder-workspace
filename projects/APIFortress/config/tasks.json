This includes identifying features, functionalities, target audience, technical constraints, security considerations, compliance requirements, integration with existing systems or third-party services (including APIs), scalability and performance requirements, and potential user experience design aspects. Additionally, provide a clear breakdown of tasks based on roles such as frontend development, backend development, database management, DevOps, QA testing, and security considerations for each task. Clearly outline the project's goals, objectives, timelines, and budget. Include research into market trends and competitor analysis to ensure our solution stands out.

    "description": "Design the overall architecture of the APIFortress solution, including the API management platform, cloud infrastructure (considering cost-effective solutions like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud), integration with existing systems, and considerations for scalability, security, performance, high availability, edge cases, error handling, and performance optimizations. The design should incorporate a modular approach for easy extensibility and maintenance, adhering to best practices for microservices architecture, following modern DevOps methodologies (such as CI/CD pipelines), and ensuring compatibility with the latest industry standards (OAS 3.0, OpenAPI). Upon completion, conduct a thorough review and documentation of the design before handing it over to the task-decomposer. The design should also cover aspects of observability, monitoring, and logging. Additionally, consider using containerization technologies such as Docker for deployment and Kubernetes for orchestration, and include a plan for container orchestration using tools like Helm or ArgoCD. Upon review, update the architecture design with any necessary revisions based on feedback before moving forward. Consider including performance benchmarks and testing strategies to validate the proposed design. Lastly, please add the following dependencies: API Design, Security Requirements Gathering, Performance Requirements Gathering, API Specification (OAS 3.0), Cloud Infrastructure Best Practices, Microservices Architecture Best Practices, CI/CD Pipeline Best Practices, and Modern Observability, Monitoring, and Logging Strategies. The updated task is ready for the 'IN_PROGRESS' state. Please update the rfc_state field accordingly.",
