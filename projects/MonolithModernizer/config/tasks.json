Conduct architectural design sessions to plan the migration of the monolithic application to a cloud-based, distributed architecture using CQRS and read-local write-global patterns. This RFC outlines the approach for each component including frontend, backend, database, and devops considerations, with a focus on ensuring transactional isolation, scalability, and performance efficiency. Suggested improvements include: 1) More detailed analysis of the current monolithic application's architecture to identify key components for migration, 2) A more explicit timeline for each phase of the project, 3) Clearer delineation of responsibilities among team members, and 4) Inclusion of potential challenges and mitigation strategies.",

This design should cater to read-local write-global patterns for global latency reduction while ensuring transactional isolation.\n\nThe proposed solution aims to expand on-premises monoliths to the cloud, reducing latency for global users while maintaining transactional isolation. The design will be broken down into the following components:\n1. Command Models\n2. Query Models\n3. Event Sourcing Strategies\n4. Event Handler Designs\n\nFor the command models, consider using immutable objects to ensure consistency and idempotency of commands. For query models, consider implementing pagination and caching strategies to improve performance.\n\nAdditionally, it would be beneficial to provide examples or use cases for each component of the design to help visualize the implementation.",

Consider a combination of databases such as PostgreSQL for transactional data and MongoDB or Cassandra for read-replicas, implementing sharding and partitioning strategies. Implement multi-master replication for write-global operations with conflict resolution mechanisms. For edge computing, explore the use of AWS Global Accelerator or similar services to minimize latency further. Address failover and disaster recovery mechanisms, such as multi-region support, backups, and point-in-time recovery. Consider implementing a hybrid sync strategy for offline scenarios and test the solution under heavy load conditions.
