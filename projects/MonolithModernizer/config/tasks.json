This design should cater to read-local write-global patterns for global latency reduction while ensuring transactional isolation.\n\nThe proposed solution aims to expand on-premises monoliths to the cloud, reducing latency for global users while maintaining transactional isolation. The design will be broken down into the following components:\n1. Command Models\n2. Query Models\n3. Event Sourcing Strategies\n4. Event Handler Designs",
