Conduct architectural design sessions to plan the migration of the monolithic application to a cloud-based, distributed architecture using CQRS and read-local write-global patterns. This RFC outlines the approach for each component including frontend, backend, database, and devops considerations, with a focus on ensuring transactional isolation, scalability, and performance efficiency. Suggested improvements include: 1) More detailed analysis of the current monolithic application's architecture to identify key components for migration, 2) A more explicit timeline for each phase of the project, 3) Clearer delineation of responsibilities among team members, and 4) Inclusion of potential challenges and mitigation strategies.",

    "description": "Design the CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) and event-driven architecture for the MonolithModernizer project's distributed system, including detailed command and query models, event sourcing strategies, and event handler designs. This design should cater to read-local write-global patterns for global latency reduction while ensuring transactional isolation.\n\nThe proposed solution aims to expand on-premises monoliths to the cloud, reducing latency for global users while maintaining transactional isolation. The design will be broken down into the following components:\n1. Command Models\n2. Query Models\n3. Event Sourcing Strategies\n4. Event Handler Designs\n\nFor the command models, consider using immutable objects to ensure consistency and idempotency of commands. For query models, consider implementing pagination, caching strategies, and efficient indexing to improve performance.\n\nAdditionally, it would be beneficial to provide examples or use cases for each component of the design to help visualize the implementation. Also, consider discussing the pros and cons of different CQRS and event sourcing patterns to ensure a well-rounded understanding.\n\nLastly, I recommend adding guidelines for monitoring and logging strategies to ensure scalability and maintainability in the long run.",

    "description": "Design the data storage and replication strategy to support the read-local write-global pattern, ensuring data consistency, low latency for global users, high availability, and transactional isolation using CQRS. Consider a combination of databases such as PostgreSQL for transactional data and MongoDB or Cassandra for read-replicas, implementing sharding and partitioning strategies. Implement multi-master replication for write-global operations with conflict resolution mechanisms like optimistic locking or last-write-wins. For edge computing, explore the use of AWS Global Accelerator or similar services to minimize latency further. Address failover and disaster recovery mechanisms, such as multi-region support, backups, and point-in-time recovery using tools like Amazon RDS Multi-AZ or Cross-Region Read Replica. Consider implementing a hybrid sync strategy for offline scenarios, and implement caching strategies to minimize load on the database. Test the solution under heavy load conditions using tools like Apache JMeter or similar. Update the task once the data storage and replication design is complete, with detailed architecture diagrams, performance benchmarks, and documentation detailing the chosen conflict resolution mechanisms, caching strategies, and offline sync methods. Address potential security concerns by implementing encryption at rest and in transit, and ensure data privacy compliance. Incorporate feedback from relevant stakeholders, including the project manager, code-architect, frontend-developer, backend-developer, database-specialist, devops-engineer, qa-tester, security-specialist, and technical-writer before proceeding to the next state. Update the task as necessary based on feedback received, and assign to the task-decomposer for further decomposition once ready.",
