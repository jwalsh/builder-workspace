This includes defining components, data flows, integration points, and addressing considerations for scalability, maintainability, performance, edge cases, error handling, and other non-functional requirements (such as security and reliability). The design should aim to facilitate easy extensibility and modifications in the future. Additionally, provide a clear documentation of the architecture and its components, including diagrams where necessary, to aid in understanding and collaboration. Include an analysis of potential bottlenecks and propose strategies for mitigation. Also, ensure the design aligns with best practices for AI system architecture.",
