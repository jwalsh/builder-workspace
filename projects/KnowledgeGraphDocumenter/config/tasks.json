Ensure the data model supports efficient querying and retrieval of information, with a focus on maintainability, modularity, scalability, and performance optimizations. Consider edge cases, error handling, and potential future expansions. Propose methods for version control and data backups to ensure data integrity, including strategies for handling large datasets. Define naming conventions and guidelines for entity and relationship types. Include considerations for indexing strategies, normalization, and denormalization techniques to optimize queries and reduce complexity. Provide examples of query patterns and potential use cases to demonstrate the practicality of the proposed data model. If applicable, suggest any necessary integrations with existing systems or APIs, and outline the benefits and challenges associated with each integration. To ensure thoroughness, also consider data privacy and security implications, and propose strategies for handling sensitive information. For the review phase, provide a clear roadmap for testing and validation, including test cases, and a plan for gathering feedback from stakeholders. Lastly, suggest any necessary documentation updates to reflect changes in the data model design. If applicable, propose a timeline for task completion. If ready for the next state, update the 'rfc_state' field accordingly.",
