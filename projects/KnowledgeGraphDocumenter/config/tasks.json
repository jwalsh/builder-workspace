Design the overall architecture of the KnowledgeGraphDocumenter system, including the components and their interactions, data flow, integration with existing systems, data storage (using NoSQL databases for scalability), scalability considerations, address potential security concerns by implementing encryption, authentication mechanisms, and a comprehensive threat model to identify any additional security requirements. Consider the use of microservices architecture for better maintainability, extendability, and scalability. This task will also involve researching best practices for knowledge graph creation, maintenance, and querying. Upon completion, document the architecture design in technical documentation for future reference. Update existing project scope and requirements to reflect this design.",

    "description": "This RFC proposes a data model for the KnowledgeGraphDocumenter project. The data model includes entities (documents, topics, people, organizations), relationships (author, mentions, belongs to), properties, and data types. The focus is on maintainability, modularity, scalability, and performance optimizations. Edge cases, error handling, and potential future expansions are considered. Methods for version control and data backups are proposed to ensure data integrity, including strategies for handling large datasets. Naming conventions and guidelines for entity and relationship types are defined. Indexing strategies, normalization, and denormalization techniques are suggested to optimize queries and reduce complexity. Query patterns and potential use cases are included to demonstrate the practicality of the proposed data model. If necessary, integrations with existing systems or APIs are suggested, along with their benefits and challenges. Data privacy and security implications are considered, and strategies for handling sensitive information are proposed. A roadmap for testing and validation, including test cases, is provided, along with a plan for gathering feedback from stakeholders. Suggestions for necessary documentation updates are made to reflect changes in the data model design. If ready for the next state, update the 'rfc_state' field accordingly.",
