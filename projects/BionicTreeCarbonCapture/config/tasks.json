Define interfaces, data flow, and communication protocols, ensuring scalability, fault tolerance, security aspects, and environmental impact. Propose a modular and extensible design to accommodate future enhancements and integration with other systems. Outline the testing strategy for the system architecture design and provide detailed documentation. This RFC will be reviewed and decomposed by the task-decomposer before being assigned to appropriate developers. The proposed design should also consider potential AI/ML integration for optimizing CO2 absorption and energy conversion efficiency. (Note: This RFC is approved, but it still needs review and decomposition by the task-decomposer.)",
