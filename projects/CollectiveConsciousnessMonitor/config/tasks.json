This should include the overall system architecture, data sources (e.g., social media, news, surveys, IoT devices), data processing pipelines (e.g., natural language processing, sentiment analysis, anomaly detection, and explainability mechanisms for AI models), visualization components (e.g., real-time dashboards, interactive maps, trend analysis, and capabilities to handle high volume, real-time data), and any other relevant aspects such as scalability, fault tolerance, security, privacy, ethical implications, and data governance considerations. The project should also outline the development roadmap, milestones, and timelines.",

Ensure that the pipeline is configured to automatically trigger on code changes and follows best practices for secure and reliable deployments. Additionally, include performance testing and monitoring stages to ensure the system's scalability and responsiveness under load. To further enhance the system's reliability and maintainability, consider incorporating practices such as automatic rolling updates and canary releases. Document the pipeline configuration and provide clear instructions on how to use it. The pipeline setup should adhere to the system architecture design (once approved). For improved maintainability, it is recommended to break down the tasks into smaller, manageable units where possible. Upon completion, review the pipeline and its documentation for any potential issues or improvements.",
