Incorporate appropriate security measures to protect sensitive user data and ensure compliance with relevant data privacy regulations. Additionally, consider integrating the database design with existing system architecture, and provide documentation on database schema design, implementation, and usage. Once completed, conduct unit testing and integration testing before pushing to production. Update the design based on feedback from the Frontend Developers to ensure seamless integration of the database with the user interface. After the design is finalized by the Database Specialist, assign the task to Backend Developer for implementation.",

Integrate with existing authentication systems such as OAuth or SSO for seamless user experience. Update documentation on the implementation of these security features, including a clear explanation of how least privilege principle is applied. Also, consider adding functionality to automatically enforce least privilege access based on user roles and actions within the system.
