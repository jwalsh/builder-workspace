Incorporate appropriate security measures to protect sensitive user data and ensure compliance with relevant data privacy regulations. Additionally, consider integrating the database design with existing system architecture, and provide documentation on database schema design, implementation, and usage. Once completed, conduct unit testing and integration testing before pushing to production. Update the design based on feedback from the Frontend Developers to ensure seamless integration of the database with the user interface.",
