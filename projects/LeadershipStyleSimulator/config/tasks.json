Consider scalability, performance, and data integrity requirements. Ensure proper indexing and normalization techniques are applied. Define data access patterns and implement necessary APIs or services for data retrieval and manipulation. Incorporate appropriate security measures to protect sensitive user data and ensure compliance with relevant data privacy regulations. Additionally, consider integrating the database design with existing system architecture, and provide documentation on database schema design, implementation, and usage. Once completed, conduct unit testing and integration testing before pushing to production. Update the design based on feedback from the Frontend Developers to ensure seamless integration of the database with the user interface. After the design is finalized by the Database Specialist, assign the task to Backend Developer for implementation.",
