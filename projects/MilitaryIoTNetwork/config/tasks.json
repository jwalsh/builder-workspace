    "description": "Prepare a comprehensive document detailing the scope, requirements, security considerations, performance expectations, scalability needs, integration points with existing military systems, compliance requirements, relevant standards, and key stakeholders for the MilitaryIoTNetwork project. Identify subject matter experts for input. This RFC is open to feedback from all team members, especially task-decomposer, project-manager, code-architect, frontend-developer, backend-developer, database-specialist, devops-engineer, qa-tester, security-specialist, technical-writer. Clarify the purpose and objectives of the network, break down requirements into more specific tasks or features for better understanding and implementation. Suggested improvements: a) Clearly define the purpose of the network, i.e., what problems will it solve? b) Structure the document to address each requirement separately for easy understanding and tracking. c) Define measurable goals or KPIs for each requirement. d) Identify potential challenges and propose solutions. e) Include a timeline for the project, with milestones and deliverables. f) Specify the technical approach, including any proprietary technologies or third-party APIs to be used. g) Provide a glossary of key terms or jargon used in the document. Upon finalization, the RFC will be reviewed by the project manager before moving to the next phase.",
