    "description": "Perform a comprehensive analysis to gather and document the detailed requirements for the quantum encryption system. This includes identifying relevant security standards (such as NIST PQC, FIPS 140-3), establishing performance targets (latency, throughput, key size), assessing integration needs with existing military communication networks, understanding user needs (ease of use, compatibility with existing devices), and addressing any other relevant requirements. Additionally, perform a SWOT analysis, risk assessment, and consider potential future-proofing against quantum computing attacks. Document all findings in a clear and concise manner for further development. This task may require input from multiple roles such as 'security-specialist', 'frontend-developer', 'backend-developer', 'database-specialist', 'devops-engineer', 'qa-tester'. Once completed, the findings will be reviewed by 'task-decomposer' and the project manager before moving forward. If necessary, input from a 'technical-writer' may also be required to help refine the documentation. Currently assigned to 'code-architect'.",

Additionally, the design should provide clear instructions for setup and usage, with intuitive error handling and troubleshooting guidance, detailed documentation, and user testing to validate usability and security. The design should also consider accessibility standards for different users.",

Additionally, consider the potential impact on system performance and usability during the deployment process. It would be beneficial to include a section on how to handle any unexpected issues that may arise during deployment. Also, consider the possibility of parallel development and testing with the design system architecture team. Lastly, add more details about the expected outcomes and benefits of this plan.",
