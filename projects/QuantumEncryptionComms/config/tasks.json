    "description": "Complete a comprehensive analysis to gather and document the detailed requirements for the quantum encryption system. This includes identifying relevant security standards (such as NIST PQC, FIPS 140-3), establishing performance targets (latency, throughput, key size), assessing integration needs with existing military communication networks, understanding user needs (ease of use, compatibility with existing devices), and addressing any other relevant requirements. Additionally, perform a SWOT analysis, risk assessment, and consider potential future-proofing against quantum computing attacks. Document all findings in a clear and concise manner for further development. This task is currently assigned to 'code-architect' but may require input from other roles such as 'security-specialist', 'frontend-developer', 'backend-developer', and 'technical-writer'.",
