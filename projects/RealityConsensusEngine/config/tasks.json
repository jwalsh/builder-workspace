    "description": "Create a detailed project scope document that outlines the objectives, requirements, and expectations of the RealityConsensusEngine. This includes identifying key philosophical perspectives to be reconciled, setting the desired level of consensus, specifying deliverables, and defining success criteria. Address potential challenges in reconciling complex philosophical concepts using AI, such as subjectivity, ambiguity, and paradoxes. Consider ethical implications, user interfaces, scalability, robustness, and future iterations or expansions. The scope document should also include a section on the methodology to be used for AI-driven reconciliation, potential pitfalls, and strategies to mitigate them. Include an outline for future iterations or expansions of the project.",

    "description": "Design the overall architecture of the RealityConsensusEngine system, focusing on the efficient processing and reconciliation of philosophical views to find common ground or a unified theory of existence. The design should include the following components: Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning models, data models, and integration points. Consider scalability, security, and interpretability for future improvements. Note that the project scope and requirements need to be defined prior to this task. Additionally, it would be beneficial to research existing work in this field for potential inspiration or collaboration opportunities. Once the project scope and requirements are established, consider incorporating techniques such as argument mining, semantic analysis, and knowledge representation for more effective reconciliation of philosophical views.",
