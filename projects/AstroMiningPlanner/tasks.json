    "description": "Gather and document the comprehensive requirements for the AstroMiningPlanner system. This includes stakeholder needs, system constraints, functional specifications, non-functional requirements (e.g., performance, security, scalability, maintainability), and any other relevant areas such as resource identification, extraction strategies, resource transportation, resource processing, and more. Involve subject matter experts and stakeholders from various domains including astronomy, geology, mining engineering, space logistics, data science, and robotics to ensure a holistic approach. The requirements gathering process should be iterative and collaborative, allowing for adjustments as new information becomes available. Once the requirements are gathered, they will be prioritized based on their impact on the project and their feasibility.",
