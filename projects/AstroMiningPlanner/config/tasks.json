    "description": "Gather and document the comprehensive requirements for the AstroMiningPlanner system. This includes stakeholder needs, system constraints, functional specifications (e.g., user interfaces, APIs, data structures), non-functional requirements (e.g., performance, security, scalability, maintainability), and any other relevant areas such as resource identification, extraction strategies, resource transportation, resource processing, and more. Collaborate with subject matter experts and stakeholders from various domains including astronomy, geology, mining engineering, space logistics, data science, robotics, UX/UI design, and software architecture to ensure a holistic approach. The requirements gathering process should be iterative and collaborative, allowing for adjustments as new information becomes available. Once the requirements are gathered, they will be prioritized based on their impact on the project and their feasibility. Additionally, consider creating user stories, use cases, and architectural diagrams to help clarify functional specifications and potential solutions. Include detailed documentation of assumptions made during this process. If any unforeseen challenges arise or if there are changes in scope, update the requirements accordingly and communicate these changes to all relevant parties. To ensure the success of this task, I suggest assigning a project manager to oversee the entire process and a code-architect to provide guidance on technical implementation details. To further streamline the process, it may be beneficial to create subtasks for each major requirement area (e.g., resource identification, extraction strategies, etc.). Once these are defined, they can be assigned to appropriate team members. The 'assigned_to' field should be updated accordingly. If necessary, consult with a technical writer to ensure clear and concise documentation.",
