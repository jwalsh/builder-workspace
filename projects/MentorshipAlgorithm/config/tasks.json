    "description": "Gather and document all functional and non-functional requirements, user stories, acceptance criteria, and data models for the MentorshipAlgorithm system. This includes details on the system's architecture, scalability, security, and accessibility requirements. In addition, specify the technologies to be used, the expected performance (response time and throughput), and any specific platform or device compatibility considerations. For scalability, consider potential future growth of the user base and the need for horizontally-scalable solutions. For security, address data privacy concerns and compliance with relevant regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA. Also, ensure the system is designed to be accessible to users with various abilities. Lastly, provide a high-level overview of the proposed system architecture, including any key components, interfaces, and APIs.",
