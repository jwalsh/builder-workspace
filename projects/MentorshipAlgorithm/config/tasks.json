    "description": "Gather and document all functional and non-functional requirements, user stories, acceptance criteria, and data models for the MentorshipAlgorithm system. This includes details on the system's architecture, scalability, security, accessibility, and performance considerations. For scalability, consider potential future growth of the user base and the need for horizontally-scalable solutions such as containerization or serverless architectures. For security, address data privacy concerns, compliance with relevant regulations including GDPR, HIPAA, and any other industry-specific requirements. Ensure the system is designed to be accessible according to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). Also, specify the technologies to be used, considering microservices architecture, serverless functions, and modern web frameworks for both frontend and backend development. Expected performance should include response time goals, throughput expectations, and any specific platform or device compatibility considerations. Provide a high-level overview of the proposed system architecture, including any key components, interfaces, APIs, and data flow diagrams if possible. Moreover, provide a detailed description of each component's functionality and interaction.",
