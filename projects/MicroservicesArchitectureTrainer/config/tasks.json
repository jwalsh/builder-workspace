    "description": "Gather and document the comprehensive requirements for the Microservices Architecture Trainer platform. This includes identifying the target audience (developers, students, professionals), learning objectives (understanding microservices architecture, hands-on coding exercises, system design challenges), desired features (interactive tutorials, quizzes, real-world case studies, community discussion forum, progress tracking and feedback mechanisms), and non-functional requirements (performance, scalability, security, accessibility, usability). Additionally, suggest potential technologies/tools for implementation. Break down the task further to ensure each requirement is addressed adequately: 1. Identify specific microservices architecture topics to cover in detail (e.g., service discovery, API gateways, distributed databases, etc.) 2. Define learning path and sequence for the platform 3. Create detailed coding exercises and system design challenges with solutions and explanations 4. Research and incorporate real-world case studies from various industries 5. Design and implement a community discussion forum for peer-to-peer interaction and help 6. Develop progress tracking and feedback mechanisms to motivate learners and improve learning experience 7. Conduct usability testing on the platform design and make necessary improvements 8. Consider potential technologies/tools for implementation such as Docker, Kubernetes, Spring Boot, React, GraphQL, MongoDB. In addition, propose a strategy for ensuring the platform remains up-to-date with emerging trends in microservices architecture. Lastly, suggest a plan for ongoing maintenance and updates of the platform content.",
