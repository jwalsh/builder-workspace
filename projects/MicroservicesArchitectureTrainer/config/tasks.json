This includes identifying the target audience (developers, students, professionals), learning objectives (understanding microservices architecture, hands-on coding exercises, system design challenges), desired features (interactive tutorials, quizzes, real-world case studies, community discussion forum), and non-functional requirements (performance, scalability, security, accessibility). Additionally, suggest potential technologies/tools for implementation. Also, consider breaking down the task further to ensure each requirement is addressed adequately.",
