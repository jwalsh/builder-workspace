This design will cover components, data flow, integration points, communication protocols, scalability and high availability, data consistency and synchronization mechanisms, fault tolerance and error handling, security and access control, monitoring and logging, performance optimization, a modular and extensible design that adheres to the microservices architecture, reliability considerations (e.g., failover strategies), disaster recovery planning, integration with existing systems, consideration of potential future scalability needs, and detailed documentation for each component and their interactions. The following areas of consideration have been added: 1) Reliability considerations (e.g., failover strategies), 2) Disaster recovery planning, 3) Integration with existing systems, and 4) Consideration of potential future scalability needs. Provide detailed documentation for each component and their interactions.",
