    "description": "Design the overall system architecture, including AI components, user interfaces, data storage solutions, and integration with third-party services (e.g., job boards, background check providers). This task will also cover the design of scalable and resilient microservices architecture to handle real-world traffic and ensure high availability. The design should take into account the performance, security, and scalability requirements for this HR platform.\n\nAdditionally, consider the following points:\n1. Implementing a modular design to facilitate easy maintenance and updates.\n2. Utilizing containerization technologies like Docker for deployments and Kubernetes for orchestration.\n3. Incorporating a CI/CD pipeline for efficient development and deployment cycles.\n4. Perform thorough research on industry-standard AI solutions for candidate screening and job matching.\n5. Investigate the use of cloud services for cost-effective and scalable storage and computing resources.\n6. Consider implementing an API gateway for secure and controlled access to microservices.",
