    "description": "Gather and document the functional and non-functional requirements for the GroupMentorshipOrganizer system, including user roles (mentor, mentee, administrator), group formation rules, communication channels (chat, email, forum), reporting capabilities (progress reports, feedback reports, performance reports), accessibility requirements, scalability considerations, security aspects, and edge cases. Also, explore potential integrations with existing systems or tools, prioritizing common education platforms and collaboration tools. Consider the system's long-term maintainability, extensibility, and usability. For the initial draft, focus on core functionalities and critical features. Once the scope is defined, break down the tasks for further development. Include performance benchmarks, mobile compatibility, and user interface/user experience design guidelines in the requirements. Revise the task to emphasize the importance of addressing privacy concerns and data protection within the system. If necessary, consult with security-specialist and legal experts during this phase.",

    "description": "Design the overall system architecture, including the components, their interactions, and the data flow. Consider scalability, security, performance requirements, and the following aspects:\n\n1. User Management: Mechanisms for user registration, authentication, and authorization, emphasizing secure storage of sensitive user information.\n2. Group Formation: Algorithms and criteria for forming mentorship groups based on factors like interests, skills, and goals. Ensure the algorithm accounts for edge cases, such as group imbalance or lack of suitable matches.\n3. Communication: Channels for group communication, such as chat, video conferencing, and file sharing, with a focus on real-time performance and reliable delivery.\n4. Progress Tracking: Tools for tracking individual and group progress, setting goals, and providing feedback, including mechanisms for measuring engagement and adjusting goals accordingly.\n5. Reporting and Analytics: Mechanisms for generating reports and insights on group performance and engagement, ensuring data privacy and anonymization where necessary.\n6. Integration: Potential integration with external services or platforms (e.g., learning management systems, video conferencing tools), considering the impact on system stability and security.\n7. Data Storage: Strategies for storing and managing user data, group data, and other relevant information, employing a combination of SQL and NoSQL databases for optimal performance and scalability.\n8. Deployment and Scaling: Considerations for deploying the system and scaling it as the user base grows, with an emphasis on auto-scaling and load balancing.\n9. Error Handling: Strategies for graceful error handling and reporting, ensuring minimal disruption to users in case of errors or downtime.\n10. Accessibility and Usability: Ensure the system is accessible and usable for all users, with a focus on inclusive design principles.",

    "description": "Design a normalized database schema for the GroupMentorshipOrganizer system that efficiently stores user profiles, group information, communication logs, and other relevant data. The schema should prioritize data integrity, scalability, performance, and follow best practices. Consider using a hybrid approach of relational (SQL) databases for structured data (e.g., user profiles, group information) and NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB) for semi-structured and unstructured data (e.g., messages, multimedia content). Ensure the schema is designed with security, privacy, and compliance in mind, including encryption of sensitive data, access controls, and adherence to relevant standards such as GDPR. Additionally, consider data partitioning and sharding strategies for scalability and performance.",
