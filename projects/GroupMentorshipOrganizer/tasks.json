Consider scalability, security, performance requirements, and the following aspects:\n\n1. User Management: Mechanisms for user registration, authentication, and authorization, emphasizing secure storage of sensitive user information.\n2. Group Formation: Algorithms and criteria for forming mentorship groups based on factors like interests, skills, and goals. Ensure the algorithm accounts for edge cases, such as group imbalance or lack of suitable matches.\n3. Communication: Channels for group communication, such as chat, video conferencing, and file sharing, with a focus on real-time performance and reliable delivery.\n4. Progress Tracking: Tools for tracking individual and group progress, setting goals, and providing feedback, including mechanisms for measuring engagement and adjusting goals accordingly.\n5. Reporting and Analytics: Mechanisms for generating reports and insights on group performance and engagement, ensuring data privacy and anonymization where necessary.\n6. Integration: Potential integration with external services or platforms (e.g., learning management systems, video conferencing tools), considering the impact on system stability and security.\n7. Data Storage: Strategies for storing and managing user data, group data, and other relevant information, employing a combination of SQL and NoSQL databases for optimal performance and scalability.\n8. Deployment and Scaling: Considerations for deploying the system and scaling it as the user base grows, with an emphasis on auto-scaling and load balancing.\n9. Error Handling: Strategies for graceful error handling and reporting, ensuring minimal disruption to users in case of errors or downtime.",
