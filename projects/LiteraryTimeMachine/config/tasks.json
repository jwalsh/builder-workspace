    "description": "Updated list of functional and non-functional requirements for the LiteraryTimeMachine project. This includes desired input formats (plain text, markdown, .docx, PDF), output formats (text, audio in various languages and speeds, visual representation as images or animations), supported historical periods with examples (Elizabethan English, Middle Ages, 1920s Jazz Age, Victorian Era, Medieval Scandinavian Sagas, etc.), performance and scalability requirements (real-time processing for short texts, ability to handle large documents within a reasonable time frame while maintaining efficient resource usage), usability considerations (user-friendly interface, clear documentation, accessibility for color-blind users, compatibility with assistive technologies), accessibility requirements (support for screen readers, high contrast mode, keyboard navigation), security constraints (data encryption at rest and in transit, user authentication and authorization, secure user data storage and handling), potential integration points (APIs for third-party text sources, text-to-speech services, machine learning models for text analysis). Additionally, consider usability, accessibility, security, and potential integration points in the context of mobile and web applications, as well as offline capabilities. Also consider possibilities of AI-assisted editing features, collaborative writing modes, and real-time feedback during text generation. For future consideration: Offline capabilities for mobile apps, further exploration into AI-assisted editing features, expansion of supported historical periods, and integration with more advanced machine learning models for improved text analysis. If necessary, revise the prioritization based on new insights or project requirements. Please update as required.",

    "title": "Design System Architecture for LiteraryTimeMachine (Revised)",
    "description": "Design the overall system architecture for the LiteraryTimeMachine project. The revised design emphasizes modularity, scalability, maintainability, and extendability for future features. It includes detailed specifications for the main components: Text Analysis Module, Language Transformation Module, Text Generation Module, User Interface. Key details include data flow (data input, processing, output, and storage), integration points, edge cases, error handling, performance optimizations, adherence to best practices, data storage requirements, deployment considerations, and security measures. This design takes into account dependencies 'Define Project Requirements' and 'Gather Language Corpora'. Upon completion, the system will be ready for implementation. The revised design also outlines strategies for handling large volumes of data, ensuring real-time processing, and implementing a robust testing framework. In addition, it includes plans for version control, monitoring, and logging to facilitate continuous improvement. To ensure thoroughness, I suggest adding sections on accessibility standards and guidelines, as well as considerations for localization and internationalization. For the future development, include a plan for integrating machine learning algorithms for improved text analysis and generation capabilities. To make the design more efficient, it would be beneficial to provide specific suggestions or libraries for each module, whenever appropriate. The revised design also highlights the importance of considering ethical implications of AI in text analysis and generation, particularly regarding cultural sensitivity and fairness. To make the task more manageable, I recommend breaking down this RFC into smaller tasks such as: System Architecture Design (Overall), Data Flow Design, Module Design (Text Analysis, Language Transformation, Text Generation, User Interface), Performance Optimization Strategy, Testing Framework Design, Version Control Plan, Monitoring and Logging Strategy, Accessibility Standards and Guidelines, Localization and Internationalization Plan, Machine Learning Integration Strategy. To maintain progress transparency, I recommend updating the 'assigned_to' field to 'project-manager', who can then delegate these tasks to appropriate team members.",
