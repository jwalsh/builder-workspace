Develop data management processes, APIs, ensure compliance with data privacy regulations (specifically GDPR, HIPAA, and CCPA), implement proper access controls, data encryption, auditing mechanisms, and consider integrating machine learning algorithms for pattern recommendation and user experience enhancement. Collaborate with System Architecture Design, Security Requirements, and Database Specialist teams to align database architecture with overall system design, security standards, and best practices. Once the dependencies are met, conduct code review, create unit tests, and perform integration testing. Document the process in a technical article for the Technical Writer team. To ensure a streamlined development process, it is suggested that the task decomposition be considered and tasks broken down further into specific areas such as data modeling, database design, data encryption, and pattern recommendation algorithms. Upon completion of these subtasks, seek review from the assigned team members before merging to the main branch.",
