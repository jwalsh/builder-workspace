Data Storage (DS) (emphasized secure and efficient data storage solutions with regular backups and disaster recovery plans), 5. Security Considerations (expanded on potential cybersecurity threats, data privacy concerns, and encryption methods for user data), Scalability/Performance Requirements (outlined scalability strategies for handling large volumes of data and ensuring system performance), Regulatory Compliance for Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) (updated to include specific regulatory bodies and compliance measures), 6. Addressing Ethical Implications and Considerations for Safe Use of the Technology (EISUT) (added section on potential ethical dilemmas, public perception, and steps to ensure safe use).

This includes: data modeling, database design, data encryption, development of APIs, ensuring compliance with data privacy regulations (specifically GDPR, HIPAA, and CCPA), implementing proper access controls, data encryption, auditing mechanisms, and consideration for integrating machine learning algorithms for pattern recommendation and user experience enhancement. Collaborate with System Architecture Design, Security Requirements, Database Specialist teams to align database architecture with overall system design, security standards, and best practices. Upon completion of these subtasks, seek review from the assigned team members before merging to the main branch. To ensure a streamlined development process, it is suggested that tasks be broken down further into specific areas such as data modeling, database design, data encryption, and pattern recommendation algorithms. Once the dependencies are met (System Architecture Design and Security Requirements), update the rfc_state field to 'DRAFT_REVISED' and assign this task to the code-architect for implementation.",
