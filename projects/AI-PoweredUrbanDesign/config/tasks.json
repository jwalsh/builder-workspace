    "description": "Gather, document, and prioritize requirements for the AI-powered urban design system. These include stakeholder needs, design constraints, data sources, performance expectations, regulatory compliance, potential use cases, and a clear roadmap for development. Ensure that both technical (sustainability, scalability, accessibility, user experience, security) and non-technical aspects are addressed, focusing on areas like sustainability, scalability, accessibility, user experience, and security. Provide a comprehensive list of stakeholders involved and their respective needs. Once complete, assign the task to the appropriate team members. To ensure thoroughness and clarity, include specific performance benchmarks, detailed data requirements, and potential edge cases to be considered. Furthermore, consider the long-term scalability of the system, and identify opportunities for expansion and improvement. Update this RFC when the requirements gathering phase is complete and ready for review by project manager. To facilitate collaboration, provide a repository or shared document where the requirements can be accessed and updated in real-time. Once the requirements are gathered, conduct a workshop with relevant stakeholders to validate and refine them.",
