    "description": "Detailed breakdown of the requirements for the Continuous Feedback Loop system. This includes desired features, user roles (Team Members, Managers, Administrators), integration with existing systems such as project management tools, collaboration platforms, and communication tools, data privacy and security considerations (GDPR, CCPA compliance, secure data storage and transmission), scalability and performance requirements, any assumptions or constraints, and a detailed outline for each component. Additionally, this task aims to create a clear roadmap for the project's development, taking into account potential future expansions, and providing a phased approach to implementation. The roadmap should include milestones, deadlines, and progress tracking mechanisms. This task also includes researching best practices for real-time feedback systems and incorporating them into the design of our system.",
