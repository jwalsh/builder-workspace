    "description": "Detailed breakdown of the requirements for the Continuous Feedback Loop system. This includes desired features, user roles (Team Members, Managers, Administrators), integration with existing systems such as project management tools, collaboration platforms, and communication tools, data privacy and security considerations (GDPR, CCPA compliance, secure data storage and transmission, and encryption for data at rest and in transit), scalability and performance requirements (elaborate on the expected user count, system uptime, and response time requirements), any assumptions or constraints, and a detailed outline for each component. Additionally, this task aims to create a clear roadmap for the project's development, taking into account potential future expansions, and providing a phased approach to implementation. The roadmap should include milestones, deadlines, progress tracking mechanisms, and clear definitions of what constitutes 'completion' for each milestone. This task also includes researching best practices for real-time feedback systems, incorporating them into the design of our system, and conducting a thorough competitive analysis to ensure our solution stands out in the market. Upon completion of this RFC, it is to be reviewed by the code-architect, project-manager, and technical-writer before proceeding to the next phase. The assigned_to field should be updated accordingly.",
