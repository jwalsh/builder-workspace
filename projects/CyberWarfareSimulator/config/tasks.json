    "description": "Design the overall system architecture, including components, data flows, and integration points. This design should consider scalability, performance, security requirements, modular design for easy maintenance and updates, separation of concerns (e.g., frontend, backend, data layer), microservices architecture for scalability and fault isolation, secure communication protocols and data encryption, robust authentication and authorization mechanisms, logging and monitoring systems, disaster recovery and backup strategies, integration with existing military systems and databases, adherence to best practices for each component. The design should ensure compliance with relevant military standards (e.g., DoD 8500 series). Implement a clear documentation strategy for all components, including API specifications, and provide a plan for testing and validating the system architecture before implementation. Consider potential future scalability needs (e.g., supporting multiple simulated environments, handling large-scale data) and aim for high availability and resilience. If approved, please update the rfc_state field to 'READY_FOR_IMPLEMENTATION'. Additionally, specify the use of containerization technologies like Docker or Kubernetes to ensure portability and ease of deployment, and recommend a preferred cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Azure) for hosting the system.",
