This will include the AI model (explicitly mentioning use of XAI for transparency and user trust, as well as a recommended AI framework such as TensorFlow or PyTorch), data pipelines (specifying Apache NiFi or Airflow), integration with financial data sources (discussing APIs like Yahoo Finance, Alpaca, or Robinhood), user interfaces (outlining a frontend stack such as React + Redux for web or Flutter for mobile platforms), deployment infrastructure (using cloud providers like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure and specifying containerization with Docker and Kubernetes), ensuring scalability, security, and performance requirements are met. Provide a detailed design document for review, addressing potential improvements, compliance analysis during the design phase, and a preliminary risk assessment. Include plans for testing, documentation, and consider conducting code reviews to ensure quality. If possible, suggest a timeline for each stage of the project. Update this task once the design document is ready for review.",
