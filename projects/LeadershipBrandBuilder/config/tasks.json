Define high-level components, their interactions, data flow, and API design where necessary. Include a clear plan for versioning and updates, with an emphasis on modularity and flexibility. For v1.0, focus on core features and MVP (Minimum Viable Product) requirements. Outline the technology stack to be used in the project, specify the system's expected throughput, provide an initial timeline for development, consider integration with other systems within the organization, and suggest potential strategies for ensuring scalability as user base grows. Additionally, address accessibility, usability, and localization concerns in the design. Also, ensure the architecture supports multi-language capabilities. Upon completion, review and update this RFC with a detailed system diagram and explanatory documentation.",
