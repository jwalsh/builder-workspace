    "description": "This RFC outlines the gathering and documentation of detailed requirements for the CTFScoreboardSystem. The focus areas include user roles and permissions, real-time scoring and leaderboard updates, challenge management, team management, submission handling, analytics/reporting, data storage, security, privacy, and non-functional requirements such as availability, reliability, and maintainability. Interviews or workshops may be conducted with key stakeholders, including contest organizers, players, and administrators to ensure a comprehensive understanding of their expectations and constraints. The overall system architecture will be defined, and potential integration points with external systems or data sources will be identified. Upon completion, this task will serve as the foundation for the development process.",
