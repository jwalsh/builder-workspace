The focus areas include user roles and permissions, real-time scoring and leaderboard updates, challenge management, team management, submission handling, and analytics/reporting. Data storage, security, and privacy requirements will be addressed. Non-functional requirements such as availability, reliability, and maintainability will be outlined. The overall system architecture will be defined, and potential integration points with external systems or data sources will be identified. To ensure a comprehensive understanding of stakeholder expectations and constraints, interviews or workshops may be conducted. Key stakeholders should include contest organizers, players, and administrators.",
