    "description": "1. Gather and document the detailed requirements for the AIRealEstateAnalyzer tool, including specific features (e.g., trend analysis, property value prediction with historical data of up to 5 years), data sources (real estate market data, historical sales data, economic indicators like inflation rate, unemployment rate, etc.), expected outputs (visualizations, reports, notifications), target users (real estate agents, investors, home buyers), performance requirements (processing speed: under 1 minute for analysis of a single property, accuracy: at least 85%, security considerations (data privacy, protection against threats such as data breaches and unauthorized access), scalability (ability to handle large datasets), maintainability (ease of updating or adding new features), and any other relevant constraints or assumptions. Include error handling mechanisms for unexpected inputs or failures.\n\n2. Prepare a comprehensive document detailing the project scope, requirements, and design considerations for review by team members and potential stakeholders. The document should be structured in a clear and concise manner, making it easy to understand and navigate for all readers.\n3. Include mockups or wireframes where necessary to illustrate the user interface. Consider using interactive prototypes to demonstrate the functionality of the tool.\n4. Collaborate with team members during the review process, address feedback, and iteratively improve the document until it is finalized. Ensure that all stakeholders are kept informed about progress and changes made.\n5. Upon finalization, conduct a pilot test with a small group of users to gather feedback and make necessary adjustments before rolling out the tool to a wider audience.\n6. Once the tool is ready for deployment, collaborate with DevOps team to ensure smooth and secure implementation.",
