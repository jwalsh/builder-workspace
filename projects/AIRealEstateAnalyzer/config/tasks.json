    "description": "1. Gather and document the detailed requirements for the AIRealEstateAnalyzer tool, including specific features (e.g., trend analysis, property value prediction with historical data of up to 5 years), data sources (real estate market data, historical sales data, economic indicators like inflation rate, unemployment rate, etc.), expected outputs (visualizations, reports, notifications), target users (real estate agents, investors, home buyers), performance requirements (processing speed: under 1 minute for analysis of a single property, accuracy: at least 85%, security considerations (data privacy, protection against threats such as data breaches and unauthorized access), scalability (ability to handle large datasets), maintainability (ease of updating or adding new features), and any other relevant constraints or assumptions. Include error handling mechanisms for unexpected inputs or failures, with specific details on how the system will recover from these situations, considering edge cases such as network errors, data inconsistencies, and invalid user input.\n\n2. Prepare a comprehensive document detailing the project scope, requirements, and design considerations for review by team members and potential stakeholders. The document should be structured in a clear and concise manner, making it easy to understand and navigate for all readers, using appropriate headings and bullet points. Ensure that the document includes a section dedicated to the architecture of the system, outlining how the various components will interact with each other, as well as a dedicated section for the user interface design (mockups or wireframes where necessary to illustrate the UI, including interactive prototypes to demonstrate functionality). Additionally, provide examples of potential visualizations and reports that users can expect from the AIRealEstateAnalyzer, considering various scenarios and edge cases.\n3. Collaborate with team members during the review process, address feedback, and iteratively improve the document until it is finalized. Ensure that all stakeholders are kept informed about progress and changes made through regular status updates using a project management tool to track progress and facilitate communication between team members.\n4. Upon finalization, conduct a pilot test with a small group of users to gather feedback and make necessary adjustments before rolling out the tool to a wider audience. Consider conducting usability testing to evaluate the user experience and identify areas for improvement.\n5. Once the tool is ready for deployment, collaborate with DevOps team to ensure smooth and secure implementation. Provide details on the deployment strategy, including any required infrastructure, database setup, and any post-deployment tasks or monitoring needed. Also, consider creating a feedback mechanism to gather user feedback and identify areas for improvement after deployment.\n6. After deploying the tool, regularly review gathered user feedback and make necessary updates and improvements to the AIRealEstateAnalyzer. Consider implementing A/B testing for feature improvements and comparing results to improve overall performance.\n7. Document all changes made during the development process and maintain a version control system for traceability and transparency.\n8. Incorporate unit testing in the development process to ensure functionality, consistency, and quality of each component of the AIRealEstateAnalyzer.\n9. Ensure that the system is designed to be flexible and adaptable to future changes or updates in real estate market trends, data sources, or user preferences.",
