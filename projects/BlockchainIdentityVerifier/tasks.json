    "description": "Gather and document all project requirements for the BlockchainIdentityVerifier system. This will include regulatory compliance (e.g., KYC, AML, GDPR), data privacy and security best practices, user experience considerations (e.g., ease of use, accessibility), technical requirements for blockchain integration (e.g., consensus mechanism, smart contracts, and wallet management), scalability considerations (e.g., sharding, off-chain storage), performance requirements (e.g., transaction throughput, latency), and disaster recovery plans. The focus should be on creating a secure, privacy-focused identity verification system that meets regulatory requirements while providing an intuitive user experience.",
