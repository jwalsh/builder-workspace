    "description": "This RFC aims to outline all project requirements for the BlockchainIdentityVerifier system. Key areas of focus include: \n1. Regulatory compliance (KYC, AML, GDPR) and data privacy best practices \n2. User experience considerations such as ease of use, accessibility, and intuitiveness\n3. Technical requirements for blockchain integration, including consensus mechanism, smart contracts, and wallet management\n4. Scalability considerations like sharding and off-chain storage\n5. Performance requirements (transaction throughput, latency)\n6. Disaster recovery plans. The goal is to create a secure, privacy-focused identity verification system that meets regulatory requirements while providing an intuitive user experience.\n\nIn addition, it would be beneficial to include the following in this RFC:\n1. Detailed functional and non-functional requirements for each component of the system\n2. A clear definition of the roles and responsibilities within the project team\n3. Establishing a timeline and milestones for each phase of the project development.\n4. A plan for ongoing maintenance, updates, and improvements to the system.",
