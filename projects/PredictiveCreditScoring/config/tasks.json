    "description": "Design the overall system architecture, including data pipelines, machine learning models, and integration with existing systems. The design should consider scalability, security, inclusivity, explainability, and ease of integrating new data sources and model updates in mind. The architecture should also prioritize data privacy, comply with relevant regulations, and emphasize on transparency and fairness. Suggested areas for improvement include: 1) Incorporate a monitoring and logging system to ensure the system's performance, security, and compliance over time. 2) Provide detailed documentation of the architecture and its components for future reference and knowledge sharing.",
