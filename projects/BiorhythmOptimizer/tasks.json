    "description": "Conduct extensive research and gather comprehensive requirements for the BiorhythmOptimizer system. This includes understanding user needs, identifying suitable biorhythm data sources, investigating scheduling algorithms, defining performance/wellbeing metrics, addressing data privacy and security concerns, exploring potential integration with existing systems or APIs, and researching third-party services or libraries to leverage for optimal functionality. Additionally, consider the following specific areas: \n1. Data Collection and Analysis: Determine the most effective methods for collecting and analyzing biorhythm data.\n2. Personalization: Identify how the system can be tailored to individual users' needs and preferences.\n3. Real-time Adaptability: Investigate how the system can adapt in real-time based on changing biorhythms or user activities.\n4. User Interface Design: Provide suggestions for a user-friendly interface that effectively communicates scheduling recommendations.",

This includes components for data ingestion, biorhythm analysis, scheduling optimization, user interfaces, and data storage. Consider scalability, performance, security, maintainability, fault tolerance, and edge cases (e.g., handling missing or inconsistent data). Define the interactions between components, data flow, and communication protocols. Identify potential third-party services or libraries to be integrated, with a focus on compatibility, licensing, and reliability. Provide detailed documentation for each component, including expected behavior. Once design is complete, conduct code reviews of related designs and ensure adherence to project standards. Upon completion, update the RFC with these details, ensuring clarity and simplicity in presentation.",
