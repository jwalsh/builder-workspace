    "title": "Gather Requirements for BiorhythmOptimizer System",
    "description": "Conduct extensive research and gather comprehensive requirements for the BiorhythmOptimizer system. This includes understanding user needs, identifying suitable biorhythm data sources, investigating scheduling algorithms, defining performance/wellbeing metrics, addressing data privacy and security concerns, exploring potential integration with existing systems or APIs, and researching third-party services or libraries to leverage for optimal functionality. The following specific areas require more attention: \n1. Data Collection and Analysis: Determine the most effective methods for collecting and analyzing biorhythm data. This should include a comparison of various data collection techniques (e.g., wearable devices, self-reporting) and analysis methods (e.g., machine learning models, statistical analyses).\n2. Personalization: Identify how the system can be tailored to individual users' needs and preferences while also considering user feedback mechanisms. This should include a plan for collecting user data, strategies for personalizing the scheduling algorithm based on this data, and methods for gathering user feedback.\n3. Real-time Adaptability: Investigate how the system can adapt in real-time based on changing biorhythms or user activities, including machine learning techniques for continuous learning. This should also include a plan for monitoring the effectiveness of the system's predictions over time and methods for updating the system as new data becomes available.\n4. User Interface Design: Provide suggestions for a user-friendly interface that effectively communicates scheduling recommendations and incorporates feedback mechanisms. This should include wireframes or mockups of potential interfaces, usability testing plans, and strategies for iteratively improving the interface based on user feedback.\n5. Cross-Platform Compatibility: Consider the development of cross-platform mobile applications as well as web interfaces to maximize accessibility. This should include a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of each platform and a plan for ensuring consistency across platforms.\n6. Documentation: Develop clear, concise, and comprehensive technical documentation for developers, testers, and other stakeholders. This should include a roadmap for the development process, detailed specifications for each feature, and examples of how to use the system's APIs.",

This includes components for data ingestion, biorhythm analysis, scheduling optimization, user interfaces, and data storage. The design should consider scalability, performance, security, maintainability, fault tolerance, and edge cases (e.g., handling missing or inconsistent data). Define the interactions between components, data flow, and communication protocols. Identify potential third-party services or libraries to be integrated, with a focus on compatibility, licensing, and reliability. Provide detailed documentation for each component, including expected behavior and edge cases. Once design is complete, conduct code reviews of related designs and ensure adherence to project standards. Upon completion, update the RFC with these details, ensuring clarity and simplicity in presentation. This task will be decomposed into smaller tasks for easier implementation. Please review the design once decomposed and provide feedback before it moves to the next state.",
