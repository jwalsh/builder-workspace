    "title": "Gather Requirements for BiorhythmOptimizer System",
    "description": "Conduct extensive research and gather comprehensive requirements for the BiorhythmOptimizer system. This includes understanding user needs, identifying suitable biorhythm data sources, investigating scheduling algorithms, defining performance/wellbeing metrics, addressing data privacy and security concerns, exploring potential integration with existing systems or APIs, and researching third-party services or libraries to leverage for optimal functionality. The following specific areas require more attention: \n1. Data Collection and Analysis: Determine the most effective methods for collecting and analyzing biorhythm data. This should include a comparison of various data collection techniques (e.g., wearable devices, self-reporting) and analysis methods (e.g., machine learning models, statistical analyses), with a focus on the pros and cons of each approach, potential limitations, and scalability considerations.\n2. Personalization: Identify how the system can be tailored to individual users' needs and preferences while also considering user feedback mechanisms. This should include a plan for collecting user data, strategies for personalizing the scheduling algorithm based on this data, methods for gathering user feedback, and a discussion of ethical considerations related to data collection and privacy.\n3. Real-time Adaptability: Investigate how the system can adapt in real-time based on changing biorhythms or user activities, including machine learning techniques for continuous learning. This should also include a plan for monitoring the effectiveness of the system's predictions over time, methods for updating the system as new data becomes available, and potential challenges and solutions related to real-time processing.\n4. User Interface Design: Provide suggestions for a user-friendly interface that effectively communicates scheduling recommendations and incorporates feedback mechanisms. This should include wireframes or mockups of potential interfaces, usability testing plans, strategies for iteratively improving the interface based on user feedback, and accessibility considerations.\n5. Cross-Platform Compatibility: Consider the development of cross-platform mobile applications as well as web interfaces to maximize accessibility. This should include a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of each platform, a plan for ensuring consistency across platforms, and potential strategies for handling platform-specific features.\n6. Documentation: Develop clear, concise, and comprehensive technical documentation for developers, testers, and other stakeholders. This should include a roadmap for the development process, detailed specifications for each feature, examples of how to use the system's APIs, and guidance on best practices for maintaining and updating the documentation.",

Incorporate feedback from the code-architect and task-decomposer during the design process. Update this RFC when the design phase is completed, including any additional details such as technology stack used for prototyping, specific components or libraries to be utilized for accessibility purposes, and if the design will support multiple languages for better global reach. Once the design is approved by the code-architect, assign it to a suitable frontend-developer for implementation. Update this RFC when the frontend development phase begins, including the assigned frontend-developer's name and their estimated timeline for completion. Also, mention any potential performance or scalability issues that might arise with the design in the 'review_comments' field if applicable.",
