    "description": "Gather and document the detailed requirements for the CTFChallengeGenerator system. The requirements should include, but are not limited to: the types of challenges (web application vulnerabilities, network attacks, cryptography, forensics), difficulty levels (beginner, intermediate, advanced), scoring mechanisms (points, time-based, partial scoring), and integration with existing cybersecurity training platforms (CTFd, HackTheBox, TryHackMe). Consider requirements for challenge generation, deployment, submission, and evaluation processes, as well as user roles and permissions, reporting, and analytics. Additionally, include edge cases, error handling, and performance optimizations to ensure scalability and maintainability of the system. Include non-functional requirements such as security, usability, reliability, and maintainability.",
