    "description": "Design the overall architecture of the NeurofeedbackPerformanceOptimizer system, encompassing components, interfaces, and data flow. The design should incorporate scalability, security, usability considerations, and follow modern software development best practices such as microservices architecture, containerization (e.g., Docker), and DevOps principles. Key focus areas include real-time data processing, machine learning algorithms for personalized feedback, integration with wearable devices, and seamless user experience across various devices and platforms. Consideration of data privacy and security will be essential in the design process. The design should also include a modular architecture that allows for easy addition or replacement of components, and a clear documentation of the architecture for easy onboarding of new team members. Additionally, performance optimization techniques such as caching and load balancing should be considered.",

    "description": "Design the database schema and data models to efficiently store user data, performance metrics, neurofeedback data, and any other relevant information required by the NeurofeedbackPerformanceOptimizer system. Ensure scalability, security, and privacy considerations are addressed. Consider incorporating normalization techniques to minimize data redundancy and improve query efficiency. Explore the possibility of using a NoSQL database for its flexibility and scalability in handling unstructured data, and for its potential advantages in terms of horizontal scaling and data consistency model. Research on database solutions that prioritize privacy such as differential privacy or federated learning methods to further enhance data security and protection. Suggest indexing strategies to optimize query performance. After designing the database schema, write a comprehensive technical document detailing the design decisions made and best practices for maintaining and updating the database. Additionally, include a section discussing potential challenges in handling sensitive neurofeedback data and proposed solutions for anonymization and pseudonymization. Lastly, suggest strategies for monitoring and ensuring the data quality, including data validation rules and regular audits. After all these considerations are addressed, update the technical document accordingly. Upon completion, this task can be marked as 'REVIEWED' and reassigned to a task-decomposer for further breakdown into subtasks if necessary.
