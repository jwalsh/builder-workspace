Ensure scalability, security, and privacy considerations are addressed. Consider incorporating normalization techniques to minimize data redundancy and improve query efficiency. Explore the possibility of using a NoSQL database for its flexibility and scalability in handling unstructured data, and for its potential advantages in terms of horizontal scaling and data consistency model. Also, research on database solutions that prioritize privacy such as differential privacy or federated learning methods to further enhance data security and protection. Lastly, suggest indexing strategies to optimize query performance. After designing the database schema, write a comprehensive technical document detailing the design decisions made and best practices for maintaining and updating the database.",
