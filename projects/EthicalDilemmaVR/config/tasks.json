This includes defining the types of ethical scenarios to be covered (e.g., dilemmas related to privacy, honesty, fairness, etc.), user experience expectations (immersive, interactive, educational, reflective), target audience demographics (age, profession, interest in ethics, VR experience), technical specifications for the VR environment (hardware recommendations: PC, VR headset, controllers; software requirements: game engine, programming language), desired interactivity (dialogue options, decision-making mechanisms, real-time feedback), ethical guidelines (sources, principles, case studies), and any other relevant aspects that will contribute to the success of this project. Ensure collaboration with team members throughout the process.",
