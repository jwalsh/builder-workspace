This includes creating a robust and scalable AR interface, defining backend services, database structure (with emphasis on normalization and optimization), and security considerations such as encryption methods and access controls. The technology stack will be defined, with an explicit focus on integration points, data flow optimization, and microservices architecture. The design aims to ensure high performance, maintainability, and scalability, while considering the importance of user experience, accessibility, and cross-platform compatibility. Upon completion, a detailed documentation including diagrams, flowcharts, and explanations will be provided for easier understanding and implementation.",
