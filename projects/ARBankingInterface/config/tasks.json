    "description": "Design the overall system architecture for the ARBankingInterface project. This includes creating a robust and scalable AR interface, defining backend services, database structure (with emphasis on normalization, optimization, and denormalization for real-time data access), and security considerations such as encryption methods (AES-256 for sensitive data) and access controls (OAuth2.0). The technology stack will be defined with an explicit focus on integration points, data flow optimization, microservices architecture, and containerization (Docker or Kubernetes). The design aims to ensure high performance, maintainability, and scalability, while considering the importance of user experience, accessibility, cross-platform compatibility, and adherence to mobile-first principles. Upon completion, a detailed documentation including diagrams, flowcharts, and explanations will be provided for easier understanding and implementation. To enhance this RFC, consider incorporating specific metrics or KPIs (such as response time, concurrency, throughput, and error rates) to measure system performance and scalability, and ensure the design is flexible enough to accommodate future updates or integrations. Additionally, include guidelines for monitoring and logging to help diagnose and resolve issues quickly. Finally, suggest a timeline for task completion and consider any potential roadblocks that may arise during implementation.",
