Ensure modularity, maintainability, and adherence to best practices. Address security, error handling, and performance optimizations. Additionally, consider the following:\n1. User Interface/User Experience design for the collaborative tool.\n2. APIs for seamless integration with other systems (if any).\n3. Implementing testing strategies for ensuring the system's robustness.\n4. Break down the task into smaller manageable sub-tasks for easier implementation, such as:\n   a. Frontend design and implementation.\n   b. Backend design and implementation.\n   c. Database design and implementation.\n   d. Integration of APIs (if any).\n   e. Testing strategies and execution. However, it would be beneficial to also include the following:\n   f. Security architecture design and implementation.\n   g. Performance testing strategies.\n   h. Documentation of architecture design.\nOnce the task is decomposed, assign the sub-tasks to appropriate team members.\nIf any new dependencies arise during task decomposition, please update the 'dependencies' field accordingly.",
