    "description": "Design the overall system architecture for a blockchain-based property title registration and transfer system, focusing on the following aspects: 1) Blockchain network (consensus mechanism, node types, and network topology), 2) Smart contracts (for title registration, transfer, and related processes), 3) Integration with existing land registry and real estate systems, secure and scalable data storage, and comprehensive security considerations (data encryption, access controls, and auditing). Also, include the following elements: interoperability and data exchange standards for seamless integration with external systems, scalability and performance requirements (transaction throughput and latency), disaster recovery and business continuity planning, user experience and interface design for different stakeholders (e.g., property owners, real estate agents, government agencies), compliance with relevant regulations and industry standards (e.g., data privacy, anti-money laundering). In addition, the design should also consider the following: 1) Implementing a modular and extendable architecture to accommodate future updates or integrations, 2) Exploring off-chain solutions for improving scalability and performance, 3) Ensuring the system's resilience against potential attacks (security best practices), 4) Providing clear documentation for each module of the system, including design decisions, technical specifications, and usage examples. If the RFC is ready for the next state, update the rfc_state field accordingly.",
