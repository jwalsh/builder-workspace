Also, include the following elements: interoperability and data exchange standards for seamless integration with external systems, scalability and performance requirements (transaction throughput and latency), disaster recovery and business continuity planning, user experience and interface design for different stakeholders (e.g., property owners, real estate agents, government agencies), compliance with relevant regulations and industry standards (e.g., data privacy, anti-money laundering).",
