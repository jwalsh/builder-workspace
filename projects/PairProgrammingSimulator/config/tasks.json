Includes a detailed breakdown of frontend, backend, and database components, communication protocols, data flow, and integration with third-party services (if any). Considered scalability, maintainability, and performance requirements. Defined high-level components and their interactions. Utilized technologies such as React for the frontend, Node.js/Express for the backend, and MongoDB/PostgreSQL for the database. Included a discussion on potential use of GraphQL or REST APIs for communication between components.",
