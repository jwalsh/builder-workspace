# RFC-001: System Architecture Design for Neural Interface System

## Status: Draft

## Description

This RFC outlines the overall architecture and design for the neural interface system of advanced bionic prosthetics, focusing on intuitive control and sensory feedback. The architecture is modular, allowing for easy replacement or upgrade of individual components, and incorporates AI and machine learning algorithms to improve control and feedback.

## Key Considerations

- Hardware and software components
- Data flow
- Integration with existing prosthetic devices
- Security
- Scalability
- Maintainability
- User experience
- Regulatory compliance
- Plan for continuous improvement
- Use of agile methodologies throughout the development process
