    "description": "Revised version of the task: Develop the overall architecture and design for the neural interface system of advanced bionic prosthetics, focusing on intuitive control and sensory feedback. The architecture should be modular, allowing for easy replacement or upgrade of individual components, and incorporate AI and machine learning algorithms to improve control and feedback. Key considerations include hardware and software components, data flow, integration with existing prosthetic devices, security, scalability, maintainability, user experience, regulatory compliance, a plan for continuous improvement, and the use of agile methodologies throughout the development process. Upon completion, the design will serve as the foundation for the development of this project. This RFC is now ready for review.",
