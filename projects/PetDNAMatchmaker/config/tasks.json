    "description": "Design the overall system architecture for PetDNAMatchmaker platform. The design should consider the following aspects:\n\n1. Frontend: Responsive UI/UX design, user authentication, and integration with backend APIs.\n2. Backend: Microservices architecture, API design, business logic implementation, secure integration with DNA analysis services (consider using HIPAA-compliant protocols), and containerization (Kubernetes is recommended for scalability and portability).\n3. Database: Data modeling for pet profiles, user profiles, DNA analysis results, and matching algorithms, including normalization and indexing strategies.\n4. DNA Analysis Integration: Secure data transfer pipelines, API integration, and efficient data processing (minimize latency and maximize accuracy). Consider utilizing Cloud-based solutions for scalable and cost-effective DNA analysis.\n5. Scalability: Horizontal scaling strategies, load balancing, and caching mechanisms to ensure high availability and performance. Utilize Content Delivery Networks (CDN) for static assets where possible.\n6. Security: Strong authentication, authorization, data encryption (end-to-end encryption is encouraged), and compliance with relevant regulations (GDPR, HIPAA). Implement security measures in accordance with OWASP guidelines.\n7. DevOps: CI/CD pipelines, containerization, and deployment strategies for efficient software delivery (Jenkins or CircleCI are viable options).\n8. Performance Optimization: Monitoring and troubleshooting strategies to maintain optimal system performance. Utilize log analysis tools (ELK Stack) and real-time monitoring services (Prometheus) to enhance visibility and manage issues proactively.\n9. Accessibility: Ensure the platform is accessible for users with disabilities, adhering to WCAG 2.1 guidelines.\n10. Documentation: Create comprehensive technical documentation, including API documentation and user guides.",
