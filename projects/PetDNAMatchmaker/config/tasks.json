    "description": "Design the overall system architecture for PetDNAMatchmaker platform. The design should consider the following aspects:\n\n1. Frontend: Responsive UI/UX design, user authentication, and integration with backend APIs.\n2. Backend: Microservices architecture, API design, business logic implementation, secure integration with DNA analysis services, and containerization (consider using Kubernetes).\n3. Database: Data modeling for pet profiles, user profiles, DNA analysis results, and matching algorithms, including normalization and indexing strategies.\n4. DNA Analysis Integration: Secure data transfer protocols (e.g., HIPAA-compliant), API integration, and efficient data processing pipelines with a focus on minimizing latency and maximizing accuracy.\n5. Scalability: Horizontal scaling strategies, load balancing, and caching mechanisms to ensure high availability and performance, including the use of Content Delivery Networks (CDN) for static assets.\n6. Security: Implement strong authentication, authorization, data encryption (consider using end-to-end encryption), and compliance with relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).\n7. DevOps: CI/CD pipelines, containerization, and deployment strategies for efficient software delivery, using tools like Jenkins or CircleCI.\n8. Performance Optimization: Monitoring and troubleshooting strategies to maintain optimal system performance, including the use of log analysis tools (e.g., ELK Stack) and real-time monitoring services (e.g., Prometheus).\n9. Accessibility: Ensure the platform is accessible for users with disabilities.\n10. Documentation: Create comprehensive technical documentation, including API documentation and user guides.",
