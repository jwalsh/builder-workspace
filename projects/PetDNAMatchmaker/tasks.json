Frontend: Responsive UI/UX design, user authentication, and integration with backend APIs.\n2. Backend: Microservices architecture, API design, business logic implementation, and integration with DNA analysis services.\n3. Database: Data modeling for pet profiles, user profiles, DNA analysis results, and matching algorithms.\n4. DNA Analysis Integration: Secure data transfer protocols, API integration, and data processing pipelines.\n5. Scalability: Horizontal scaling strategies, load balancing, and caching mechanisms.\n6. Security: Authentication, authorization, data encryption, and compliance with relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).\n7. DevOps: CI/CD pipelines, containerization, and deployment strategies.",
