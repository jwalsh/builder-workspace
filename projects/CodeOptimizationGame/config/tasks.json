    "title": "Design system architecture (Revised)",
    "description": "Design the overall system architecture as described in the previous RFC, with the following modifications and additions:\n\n1. Frontend: Consider implementing a hybrid mobile application using React Native for iOS and Android platforms in addition to the PWA, providing a consistent user experience across devices.\n\n2. Backend: Incorporate serverless architecture into the backend system by utilizing AWS Lambda or similar services for event-driven, scalable, and cost-effective processing.\n\n3. Gamification: Consider implementing adaptive gamification to personalize the user experience based on individual preferences, behavior, and skill levels, further encouraging engagement.\n\n4. Performance Optimization: Implement automatic caching using Content Delivery Networks (CDN) for faster content delivery and improved performance. Additionally, consider profiling high-impact functions to identify bottlenecks and optimize them accordingly.\n\n5. Security: Use HTTPS for secure data transfer and implement JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication and authorization to ensure secure access and prevent unauthorized activities. Furthermore, perform security audits regularly to address any vulnerabilities.\n\n6. Integration: Plan for potential integrations with popular code analysis tools like ESLint, TAU, or Google Closure Tools for improved optimization techniques. Also, consider creating APIs for seamless integration with third-party services.\n\n7. Monitoring and Logging: Implement real-time monitoring and alerting using services such as Splunk or Datadog to instantly identify issues and improve troubleshooting efficiency. Implement logging best practices for debugging purposes.\n\n8. Deployment and DevOps: Plan for continuous deployment on Kubernetes clusters for improved scalability, flexibility, and ease of management. Follow best practices for containerization (e.g., Docker) and orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes).\n\n9. Testing: Allocate resources for unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests using test automation frameworks like Mocha or Jest to ensure system reliability. Perform regression testing to maintain the quality of existing features.\n\n10. Documentation: Assign a technical writer to create comprehensive documentation for the project, including API reference, user guides, and developer guides.\n\nNote that these suggestions are not exhaustive, but they aim to provide a more holistic approach towards the design of the system architecture.",
