    "description": "Detailed project requirements will be gathered and documented, focusing on user experience, technical constraints, success criteria, potential risks and challenges related to quantum teleportation technology. This includes specific feature details (such as virtual environment quality, teleportation speed, safety measures), technical specifications (hardware and software requirements), a detailed risk analysis with mitigation strategies. Additionally, consider the ethical implications of such a system, data privacy concerns, compatibility with existing travel industry regulations, and the impact on mental health due to rapid destination changes. Furthermore, the document will include a comprehensive review of the current state of quantum teleportation technology and its potential future developments. Upon completion, this RFC will be open for discussion and feedback from relevant team members. If approved, the next step would be task decomposition.",
