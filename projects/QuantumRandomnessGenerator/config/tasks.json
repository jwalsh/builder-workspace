Assess their feasibility, security, and performance characteristics, focusing on both theoretical aspects and potential practical implementations. Since this task involves significant research and requires a deep understanding of quantum mechanics, it is recommended to involve the code-architect, project-manager, and potentially experts from various domains such as Quantum Physics and Applied Mathematics for guidance and oversight. The aim is to provide a comprehensive analysis that could lead to an informed decision about the best approach for our system. Since this task is in its draft stage, it is open for suggestions and improvements.",
