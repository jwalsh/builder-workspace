The project will focus on developing quantum algorithms for cryptography and drug discovery applications using quantum computing simulators. Specific algorithms include Shor's algorithm, Grover's algorithm, Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods, and variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). Performance goals have been established, and constraints, assumptions, and relevant industry standards have been identified. A list of target applications is included.",
