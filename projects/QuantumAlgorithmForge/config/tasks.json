    "description": "The project requirements have been thoroughly reviewed and updated. The focus is on the development of quantum algorithms for cryptography and drug discovery applications, using quantum computing simulators. Specifically, Shor's algorithm, Grover's algorithm, Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods, and variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) will be implemented. Performance goals have been set, and constraints, assumptions, and relevant industry standards have been identified. A list of target applications is provided. For the sake of clarity, the project's objectives are broken down into manageable tasks. It is now ready for implementation.",

Additionally, it is recommended to consider using frameworks like TensorFlow Quantum for certain tasks. Also, document the architecture design choices and rationale, as well as any potential challenges or limitations.",
