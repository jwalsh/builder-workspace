    "description": "This RFC details the design of the overall system architecture for the InteractiveCodePlayground project. The following aspects are covered: frontend, backend, and database components; communication protocols, data flow, integration points with third-party services, scalability and performance considerations, microservices architecture for a modular and maintainable solution, security, usability, and accessibility best practices. Additionally, this RFC includes a detailed design document that outlines these aspects. Please note that this task depends on the completion of 'Define Project Requirements' and 'Identify External Dependencies and Integrations'.",
