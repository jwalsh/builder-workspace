    "description": "Design the overall system architecture, prioritizing scalability, maintainability, and performance. Consider a microservices architecture with separate services for different functionalities (e.g., real-time collaboration, version control, access control). Ensure proper separation of concerns and modular design. Incorporate real-time collaboration features using WebSockets or similar technologies. Define data models and database schemas, considering normalized design for efficiency and scalability. Outline the technology stack (e.g., programming languages, frameworks, databases), ensuring compatibility with chosen tech stack. Address security considerations, including authentication, authorization, and data protection. Provide guidelines for deployment, monitoring, and logging, considering DevOps practices and tooling such as Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines. Suggest strategies for handling concurrency and real-time collaboration at scale. Address scalability concerns for the database, considering sharding or partitioning strategies. Also, consider adding features such as version history tracking, comments, and notifications for collaborative editing. Additionally, suggest a plan for testing and validation of the system architecture design.",
