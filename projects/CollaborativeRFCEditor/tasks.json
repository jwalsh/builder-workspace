Consider using a microservices architecture with separate services for different functionalities. Ensure proper separation of concerns and modular design. Incorporate real-time collaboration features, version control, and access control mechanisms. Define the data models and database schemas. Outline the technology stack and programming languages to be used. Address security considerations, such as authentication, authorization, and data protection. Provide guidelines for deployment, monitoring, and logging.",
