    "description": "Design the overall system architecture, including data ingestion, processing, storage, analysis, and visualization components. Consider the following aspects:\n\n1. Data Ingestion: Define mechanisms to ingest threat intelligence data from various sources (e.g., open-source intelligence, commercial feeds, honeypots) in different formats (e.g., CSV, JSON, XML).\n2. Data Processing: Outline the data processing pipeline, including data parsing, normalization, enrichment, and deduplication.\n3. Data Storage: Determine the appropriate storage solution(s) for structured and unstructured data, considering scalability, performance, and querying requirements.\n4. Data Analysis: Design the analysis engine to correlate and analyze threat data, identify patterns, and generate actionable insights.\n5. Visualization and Reporting: Define the user interface and reporting mechanisms to present insights and enable interactive exploration of the data.\n6. Security and Access Control: Implement robust security measures, including authentication, authorization, data encryption, and auditing.\n7. Scalability and Performance: Ensure the architecture can handle increasing data volumes and user loads while maintaining acceptable performance.\n8. Integration and APIs: Design APIs and integration points for seamless data exchange with other systems or third-party tools.",
