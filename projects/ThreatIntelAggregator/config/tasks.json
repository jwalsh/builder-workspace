    "title": "Architecture Design",
    "description": "Design the overall system architecture for the ThreatIntelAggregator platform, which aggregates and analyzes threat intelligence from multiple sources. The design should encompass the following components:\n\n1. Data Ingestion: Define mechanisms to ingest threat intelligence data from various sources (e.g., open-source intelligence, commercial feeds, honeypots) in different formats (e.g., CSV, JSON, XML). This component will include a data validation step to ensure the quality and integrity of the incoming data.\n2. Data Processing: Outline the data processing pipeline, including data parsing, normalization, enrichment, and deduplication. The design should also account for real-time data processing where necessary.\n3. Data Storage: Determine the appropriate storage solution(s) for structured and unstructured data, considering scalability, performance, and querying requirements. In addition, discuss data sharding strategies for optimizing performance as the volume of data grows.\n4. Data Analysis: Design an analysis engine to correlate and analyze threat data, identify patterns, and generate actionable insights. This component will also include machine learning algorithms for anomaly detection and predictive modeling.\n5. Visualization and Reporting: Define the user interface and reporting mechanisms to present insights and enable interactive exploration of the data. Include options for customizable dashboards and alerts based on user-defined threat criteria.\n6. Security and Access Control: Implement robust security measures, including authentication, authorization, data encryption, and auditing. This component will also address potential threats from insider attacks and DDoS attacks.\n7. Scalability and Performance: Ensure the architecture can handle increasing data volumes and user loads while maintaining acceptable performance. Discuss horizontal scaling strategies and caching mechanisms to optimize system performance.\n8. Integration and APIs: Design APIs and integration points for seamless data exchange with other systems or third-party tools. This component will also discuss webhooks for real-time data updates from external sources.\n9. Monitoring and Logging: Implement logging, monitoring, and alerting mechanisms to ensure system reliability and identify potential issues. Include options for customizable alert thresholds and notifications.\n10. Documentation: Provide clear documentation on the architecture design and implementation. This documentation should include technical specifications, architecture diagrams, and best practices for using the platform.",
