Employ microservices architecture, event-driven architecture, and serverless functions where applicable. Outline the technology stack, deployment strategy, and monitoring/logging approach. For scalability, security, performance, and maintainability, prioritize modularity, decoupling, and resilience. Provide a detailed explanation of how data privacy and security will be maintained, including compliance with GDPR, HIPAA, and other relevant regulations. Include a section discussing future scalability plans as the platform grows. Additionally, consider the integration of real-time analytics for improved user experience and insights. Lastly, highlight the importance of regular security audits and updates to ensure ongoing data protection. To facilitate better collaboration and understanding, include diagrams or flowcharts where appropriate.",

This task involves integrating machine learning models (such as Convolutional Neural Networks for image analysis), veterinary knowledge bases, and a user-friendly interface. The system should provide accurate diagnostic suggestions and tailored treatment recommendations based on pet symptoms, with an emphasis on continuous learning to improve accuracy over time. Additionally, the system should be designed to handle various types of pets (cats, dogs, etc.) and their unique health issues. To ensure efficiency and effectiveness, it's essential to prioritize real-time data processing and secure user data storage. Also, consider integrating a feature for human experts' intervention when needed.",
