    "description": "Revised system architecture design, including the AI engine, user interface, data storage components, and integration points. This includes a detailed technology stack considering scalability, maintainability, performance, security, accessibility, edge cases, error handling, and user experience. The design will be broken down into microservices, adhering to 12-factor app principles and using containerization for deployment and CI/CD pipelines for continuous integration and delivery. To reflect the latest AI/ML best practices and emerging technologies, the system architecture will incorporate state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms and advanced natural language processing techniques. The design will also emphasize modularity for ease of development and maintenance, with a clear definition of roles and responsibilities of each component or service within the system.",

    "description": "Design and implement a secure, scalable, and high-performance data storage solution for the Algorithmic Thinking Tutor project. The solution will store user data, problem sets, and algorithmic thinking resources, ensuring data integrity, security, and efficient retrieval using a combination of relational (e.g., PostgreSQL) and NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB or DynamoDB). Implement proper data access controls, encryption at rest and in transit, backup/recovery mechanisms (consider services like AWS S3), and versioning for data. Design the data models and schemas to support efficient querying and data retrieval for the application's use cases. Additionally, implement caching mechanisms (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed data to improve performance. Ensure data storage and management solutions align with the overall system architecture and adhere to best practices for maintainability, modularity, and scalability. Collaborate with the assigned team members during the development process to ensure a cohesive and high-quality implementation.\n\nFor the purposes of this RFC, I suggest considering the following additional aspects: 1) Performance testing and optimization to ensure that the chosen databases can handle the expected load, 2) Data migration strategy for any existing data, if applicable, 3) Monitoring and logging solutions to track database performance and identify potential issues early, 4) Integration with other system components such as the user authentication system and the AI component, 5) Document the design decisions made during this process in the technical documentation to facilitate future maintenance. Update the rfc_state field to 'IN_PROGRESS'.\n\nPlease note that the following improvements have been suggested:\n- Clearly define the performance metrics for load handling, and provide a plan for monitoring and optimizing database performance as needed.\n- Specify a strategy for data migration from any existing databases, if applicable.\n- Provide details on the monitoring and logging tools to be used, such as Prometheus or Grafana for monitoring, and Splunk or ELK Stack for logging.\n- Outline integration plans with other system components, including API specifications and expected interactions between components.\n- Include a section in technical documentation to discuss data storage and management design decisions and rationale.\n\nIn addition, I recommend the following changes:\n- Update the 'assigned_to' field to 'backend-developer' as this task involves backend development.\n- Clarify that the 'IN_PROGRESS' status refers to the approval state of the RFC, not the current development state. The implementation state should be updated as the work progresses.\n- Suggest adding a section on disaster recovery and data backup strategies in case of unexpected failures or data loss.",
