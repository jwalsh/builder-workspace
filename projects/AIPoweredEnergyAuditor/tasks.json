    "description": "Design the overall architecture of the AI-powered energy auditor system, including components, data flows, integration points, scalability considerations, security measures, deployment strategies, and outline an approach for handling large datasets and real-time data processing. Consider adopting a microservices architecture for flexibility and ease of maintenance. The design should align with the project's objectives, prioritize performance, reliability, and maintainability. Also, focus on modularity and extensibility to accommodate potential future enhancements. Break down the system into logical components: Data Collection Service, Data Processing Service, Machine Learning Service, User Interface Service, and Database Service. Clearly define their interactions and responsibilities. Include an outline of the data model, data storage strategies, APIs, and the choice of technologies for each component. For Data Collection Service, use IoT devices for energy meter readings and building sensor data. Implement real-time data processing using streaming platforms like Apache Kafka or AWS Kinesis. For Data Processing Service, perform feature engineering, anomaly detection, and time-series analysis to prepare the data for machine learning models. Use Python libraries like Pandas and Scikit-learn for these tasks. For Machine Learning Service, train models using deep learning techniques to predict energy consumption patterns and suggest optimizations. Implement model monitoring and retraining capabilities. For User Interface Service, create a user-friendly dashboard to visualize the audit results, recommendations, and historical data trends. Use modern web frameworks like React or Angular for this. For Database Service, use a combination of SQL and NoSQL databases like PostgreSQL and MongoDB to store structured and unstructured data respectively. Implement data encryption at rest and in transit for security measures. Once the design is complete, conduct a thorough review and testing before moving to the next stage.",
