    "description": "This RFC aims to gather and document the detailed functional and non-functional requirements for the Drone Patrol Network project. The requirements will include, but are not limited to, technical specifications (e.g., drone hardware, communication infrastructure), stakeholder needs, regulatory and legal considerations, privacy and security concerns, ethical implications, potential risks and mitigation strategies. Additionally, this RFC proposes a high-level architecture overview of the system, outlining key components such as drone hardware, communication infrastructure, data storage, user interfaces, and software architecture for each component. The documentation will serve as a basis for further project development. To ensure comprehensive coverage and to facilitate efficient task decomposition, it is suggested to involve experts in various domains (code-architect, frontend-developer, backend-developer, database-specialist, devops-engineer, QA-tester, security-specialist, technical-writer) during the process. The final document will be reviewed by the project manager and approved prior to the commencement of development. *Technical specifications: Consider adding a section for potential future upgrades or expansions, as well as power management strategies.*Privacy and security concerns: Address potential privacy issues related to data collection and storage, and propose methods for anonymizing data where possible. Include details on encryption, access control, and data retention policies.*Ethical implications: Discuss potential ethical dilemmas that may arise from the use of autonomous drones in urban environments, and propose guidelines to address these concerns.*Potential risks and mitigation strategies: Identify key risks associated with the project (e.g., hardware failures, cybersecurity threats) and outline strategies for minimizing their impact. *Upon review, it is suggested to add a section for testing and validation strategies, and to involve QA-tester in the process.",
