    "description": "Conduct stakeholder interviews, market research, and document detailed requirements including supported languages (English, French, Spanish, German, Mandarin), data sources (social media platforms, news outlets, customer feedback forms), analysis techniques (sentiment analysis, topic modeling), performance requirements (response time less than 5 seconds for small datasets, scalable for larger datasets, with benchmarks provided), security considerations (data encryption, access controls, and compliance with GDPR/CCPA as applicable), integration with existing systems (CRM, Marketing Automation Platforms, API documentation provided). Consider the potential need for language-specific nuances in sentiment analysis and the importance of maintaining a diverse team to account for cultural differences. Emphasize on the importance of monitoring and updating the system to adapt to evolving language patterns and cultural trends. Include a section discussing the approach to handle missing or untranslatable words in multilingual analysis, focusing particularly on strategies like synonym detection, context-based translation, and back-translation. Propose a phased development plan for implementation, focusing on the following roles: task-decomposer, project-manager, frontend-developer, backend-developer, database-specialist, devops-engineer, qa-tester, security-specialist, technical-writer, linguistic specialist, UX/UI designer. Ensure that the system is designed to accommodate future language additions. Lastly, provide a comprehensive report summarizing findings and recommendations. If needed, propose a timeline for each phase of development. If the proposed plan requires additional resources or dependencies, update accordingly.

    "description": "Update the overall system architecture design, focusing on optimizing it for multilingual support, scalability, performance, security, maintainability, modularity, extensibility, ease of maintenance, and future expansion of features and languages. The updated design will consider using a microservices architecture to facilitate independent scaling of each service. For better clarity, provide an expanded list of components, their roles, responsibilities, and interconnections. Additionally, include a detailed diagram or visual representation of the proposed architecture. Conduct a thorough review of the design from a security perspective, identifying potential vulnerabilities and proposing mitigation strategies. Ensure that the Requirements Gathering and Analysis have been addressed as prerequisites. Once the design is finalized, revised, and reviewed, it will be ready for implementation. Upon completion, submit the updated design and review comments for further review.",

The design should be able to handle multiple languages, accommodate future language additions, and consider the needs of enterprises operating on international markets. Ensure data security by implementing appropriate measures such as encryption at rest and in transit, access controls, and auditing. To ensure scalability, the design should be modular and allow for easy integration with other systems. The design should also prioritize performance optimization. Provide a clear documentation for the implementation, including architecture diagrams, code examples, and best practices for usage. Note that the design should also address real-time processing requirements for streaming data sources and provide mechanisms for handling large volumes of data. Update the rfc_state field to 'IMPLEMENTATION_IN_PROGRESS' once work begins. To facilitate efficient collaboration and coordination between team members, consider dividing the task into smaller subtasks (task decomposition). This will help in tracking progress, assigning tasks, and ensuring timely completion of the project. Additionally, include a plan for testing and quality assurance to ensure the system is robust and reliable.",

The design should consider factors such as data volume, performance, scalability, security, and internationalization. This includes planning for efficient indexing, data compression, and multi-region deployment to ensure fast and reliable access worldwide. The design should be flexible enough to accommodate various languages, follow best practices for database normalization, support efficient querying, and optimize the database for real-time analysis. Additionally, the design should take into account the need for machine learning algorithms to improve sentiment analysis accuracy over time. To enhance readability and clarity, tasks will be broken down into smaller, more manageable pieces. The design should be compatible with popular SQL databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB. A detailed timeline for each task, including an estimated completion date, will be provided.
