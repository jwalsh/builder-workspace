Consider the potential need for language-specific nuances in sentiment analysis and the importance of maintaining a diverse team to account for cultural differences. Also, emphasize on the importance of monitoring and updating the system to adapt to evolving language patterns and cultural trends. Include a section discussing the approach to handle missing or untranslatable words in multilingual analysis. Lastly, provide a comprehensive report summarizing findings and recommendations. If needed, propose a phased development plan for implementation.",

The architecture should consider the following aspects: multilingual support, scalability, performance, security, and maintainability. Additionally, ensure that the design aligns with best practices for modularity, extensibility, and ease of maintenance. Consider using microservices architecture to enable independent scaling of each service and to facilitate integration with third-party services. For better clarity, also include a detailed list of components, their roles, and interconnections. Furthermore, consider the future expansion of features and languages, and ensure that the design is adaptable to such changes. To streamline the process and encourage collaboration, create a diagram or visual representation of the proposed architecture. Include in the design the following dependencies: Requirements Gathering and Analysis. Lastly, review the design from a security perspective to identify potential vulnerabilities.",
