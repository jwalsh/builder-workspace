The architecture should consider the following aspects: multilingual support, scalability, performance, security, and maintainability. Additionally, ensure that the design aligns with best practices for modularity, extensibility, and ease of maintenance. Consider using microservices architecture to enable independent scaling of each service and to facilitate integration with third-party services. For better clarity, also include a detailed list of components, their roles, and interconnections. Furthermore, consider the future expansion of features and languages, and ensure that the design is adaptable to such changes.",
