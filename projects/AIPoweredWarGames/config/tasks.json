    "description": "Compile a comprehensive list of detailed requirements for the AI-powered war game system. This includes functional and non-functional requirements, user stories, acceptance criteria, ethical and legal considerations related to the use of AI in military applications, data privacy and security measures for sensitive military data, potential risks and mitigation strategies, as well as guidelines for responsible AI usage in the context of military simulations. The initial architecture design will be based on the gathered requirements and should include a clear breakdown of frontend, backend, and database components, with emphasis on scalability, performance, and security considerations. This task is further divided into several sub-tasks to ensure comprehensive coverage. Upon completion, each sub-task will be documented and submitted for review and approval. To facilitate efficient collaboration and decision-making, it would be beneficial to establish a working group consisting of relevant stakeholders including but not limited to subject matter experts, developers, security professionals, legal advisors, and project manager. Once the requirements are gathered and the initial design is approved, assign the task to the code-architect for further development. In order to ensure progress and address any arising issues in a timely manner, regular meetings should be scheduled with the working group. To document the progress and discuss the findings, create a shared workspace or wiki page where all relevant documents can be stored and updated in real time. Upon completion of each sub-task, update this RFC with the link to the corresponding documentation for review and approval.",
