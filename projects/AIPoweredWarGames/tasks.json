    "description": "Compile a comprehensive list of detailed requirements for the AI-powered war game system. This includes functional and non-functional requirements, user stories, acceptance criteria, ethical and legal considerations related to the use of AI in military applications, data privacy and security measures for sensitive military data, potential risks and mitigation strategies, as well as guidelines for responsible AI usage in the context of military simulations. The initial architecture design will be based on the gathered requirements and should include a clear breakdown of frontend, backend, and database components, with emphasis on scalability, performance, and security considerations. This task is further divided into several sub-tasks to ensure comprehensive coverage. Upon completion, each sub-task will be documented and submitted for review and approval. To facilitate efficient collaboration and decision-making, it would be beneficial to establish a working group consisting of relevant stakeholders including but not limited to subject matter experts, developers, security professionals, and legal advisors.",
