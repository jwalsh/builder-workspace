    "description": "This RFC outlines the detailed requirements for the IndustrialOptimizer project. The project aims to enable enterprises to scale faster, optimize their industrial operations in real-time, and accelerate digital transformation initiatives. Specifically, the following industrial operations will be optimized: manufacturing, logistics, energy consumption. Optimization goals include cost reduction, efficiency improvement, resource utilization. Digital transformation initiatives encompass IoT integration, predictive maintenance, AI-powered decision making. This document serves as a roadmap for the project, outlining dependencies with other tasks or RFCs, potential impacts on existing systems, and necessary assumptions. Possible solutions or approaches to the defined requirements are suggested. Since this is a critical task, it is prioritized higher in the task list.",

    "description": "This updated RFC provides a revised design of the overall system architecture for the IndustrialOptimizer. Detailed descriptions of components, data flows, integration points with existing systems, scalability considerations, security measures, and deployment strategies are included. Visual representations such as diagrams have been added to enhance understanding. The revised design aims to enable enterprises to scale faster, optimize their industrial operations in real time, and accelerate their digital transformation initiatives. However, it is recommended to include a section for potential challenges or limitations that may arise during the implementation phase, along with proposed mitigation strategies.",
