    "description": "Clearly outline the detailed requirements for the IndustrialOptimizer project. This should include specific industrial operations to be optimized such as manufacturing, logistics, energy consumption, desired optimization goals like cost reduction, efficiency improvement, resource utilization, and digital transformation initiatives including IoT integration, predictive maintenance, AI-powered decision making. Clearly define any dependencies with other tasks or RFCs, outline potential impacts on existing systems, and include necessary assumptions. Provide suggestions for possible solutions or approaches to the defined requirements. Ensure that the deliverable is a comprehensive and well-structured document which serves as a roadmap for the project. Since this is a critical task, I suggest prioritizing it higher in the task list.",
