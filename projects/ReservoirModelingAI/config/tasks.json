The UI should be intuitive, responsive, and provide a seamless experience for users to explore and manipulate 3D reservoir models, visualize data overlays, and access analysis results. It should also support collaboration features for multiple users to work on the same model simultaneously. The design should prioritize accessibility and usability for both experts and non-experts in oil and gas industry. Collaborate with UX/UI designers if necessary. Consider incorporating feedback from our team's domain experts (geophysicists, reservoir engineers) to ensure accuracy and utility of the UI elements. Update the design documentation to clearly illustrate the intended functionality and interaction of each feature. This will facilitate better understanding among all stakeholders. Once the design is approved by the project manager, assign it to a frontend-developer for implementation.",
