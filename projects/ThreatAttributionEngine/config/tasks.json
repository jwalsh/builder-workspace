    "title": "Define Project Scope and Requirements - RFC Review",
    "description": "This RFC proposes the gathering and documentation of requirements for the ThreatAttributionEngine. The requirements include, but are not limited to, the types of attack patterns and techniques to be analyzed (e.g., network attacks, phishing, malware, insider threats), desired level of attribution accuracy, data sources for threat intelligence (open-source, proprietary, or a combination), expected output formats (reports, APIs, dashboards), specific use cases or scenarios to be supported (real-time analysis, historical analysis, integration with SIEM systems), any regulatory or compliance requirements that need to be considered, potential performance or scalability requirements, and the system's ability to handle large volumes of data efficiently. Additionally, it is important to consider the system's interface design for user interaction. After reviewing this RFC, please provide feedback or suggest improvements as necessary. If the RFC is ready for the next state, update the 'rfc_state' field accordingly. Suggested changes include clarifying the need for a user-friendly interface and adding the task of defining the system architecture.",
