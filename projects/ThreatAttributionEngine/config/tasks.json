    "description": "This RFC proposes the gathering and documentation of requirements for the ThreatAttributionEngine. The requirements include, but are not limited to, the types of attack patterns and techniques to be analyzed (e.g., network attacks, phishing, malware), desired level of attribution accuracy, data sources for threat intelligence (open-source, proprietary, or a combination), expected output formats (reports, APIs, dashboards), specific use cases or scenarios to be supported (real-time analysis, historical analysis), and any regulatory or compliance requirements that need to be considered. Additionally, it's important to consider potential integration with existing security systems and any performance or scalability requirements. After reviewing this RFC, please provide feedback or suggest improvements as necessary. If the RFC is ready for the next state, update the 'rfc_state' field accordingly.",
