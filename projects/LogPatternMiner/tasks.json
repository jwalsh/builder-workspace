    "description": "Comprehensively outline and document the requirements for the LogPatternMiner system. Input data formats include structured log files in CSV or JSON format, expected outputs are patterns represented in clear text, visualizations, and performance metrics. Performance criteria encompass processing time per GB of log data (< 1 hour) and accuracy of pattern detection (> 95%). System architecture is to be described at a high level, including machine learning models, data pre-processing layers, and user interface elements. Scalable data storage solutions like AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage are required for real-time or batch processing options. Security and privacy considerations include encryption at rest and in transit, anonymization techniques, and data access controls. The user interface will feature intuitive UI with search functionality, export options, and real-time feedback on pattern detection. Edge cases, exceptions, and system failures should be handled gracefully by the system. Guidelines for these scenarios should be provided. This task includes providing guidelines for data storage and processing requirements, performance criteria, system architecture, security and privacy considerations, user interface specifications, and handling edge cases, exceptions, and system failures.",
