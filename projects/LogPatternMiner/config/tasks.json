    "description": "Comprehensively outline and document the requirements for the LogPatternMiner system. The system will process structured log files in CSV or JSON format, generating clear text patterns, visualizations, and performance metrics. Performance criteria require processing time per GB of log data to be less than 1 hour with an accuracy of pattern detection greater than 95%. A high-level system architecture should describe machine learning models, data pre-processing layers, user interface elements, and scalable data storage solutions such as AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage for real-time or batch processing options. Security and privacy considerations include encryption at rest and in transit, anonymization techniques, data access controls, and guidelines on these topics. The user interface will feature a search function, export options, and real-time feedback on pattern detection. Edge cases, exceptions, and system failures should be handled gracefully by the system with provided guidelines. This task includes providing guidelines for data storage and processing requirements, performance criteria, system architecture, security and privacy considerations, user interface specifications, and handling edge cases, exceptions, and system failures. Upon review and approval, this RFC will move forward to implementation.",
