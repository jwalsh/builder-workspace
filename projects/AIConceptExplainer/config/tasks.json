    "title": "Define Project Scope and Requirements",
    "description": "The task description has been revised to include a more detailed breakdown of the functional requirements: (1) Define the range of programming concepts, algorithms, and data structures to be covered - Data Structures: arrays, linked lists, trees, stacks, queues; Algorithms: sorting, searching, graph traversal, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms; Programming Concepts: variables, functions, loops, conditionals, objects, classes, exceptions. (2) Specify the target audience, learning levels (beginner, intermediate, advanced), and desired user experience - interactive tutorials, quizzes, or coding challenges. (3) Determine the integration requirements with external resources or APIs, such as programming language documentation, code repositories, or popular AI platforms for seamless user experiences. Additionally, define the project's scope, objectives, success criteria, and any constraints or assumptions. The revised description also includes considerations for scalability, accessibility, and localization to cater to a global audience. To further enhance the RFC, it would be beneficial to add specific details on how the system will handle multilingual support and accessibility features for visually impaired users - Support for screen readers, text-to-speech, high-contrast modes, compatibility with assistive technologies like magnifiers or braille displays. This could also include subtitles/captions in multiple languages for videos, and compatibility with closed captioning systems. (4) Finally, outline the project timeline with key milestones and deadlines. To ensure a comprehensive review, I suggest adding the following points to the RFC: (a) User interface design - wireframes or mockups of the main screens, menus, and navigation; (b) Performance considerations - expected processing time for different operations, data storage requirements, and server load management; (c) Security measures - authentication, authorization, data encryption, and regular security audits. The RFC is now ready for further refinement and can be reassigned to a Task Decomposer or Project Manager.",
