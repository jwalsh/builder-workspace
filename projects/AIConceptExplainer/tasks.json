    "description": "Revised to include a more detailed breakdown of the functional requirements: (1) Define the range of programming concepts, algorithms, and data structures to be covered (e.g., data structures - arrays, linked lists, trees, stacks, queues; algorithms - sorting, searching, graph traversal, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms; programming concepts - variables, functions, loops, conditionals, objects, classes, exceptions). (2) Specify the target audience, learning levels (beginner, intermediate, advanced), and desired user experience (e.g., interactive tutorials, quizzes, or coding challenges). (3) Determine the integration requirements with external resources or APIs, such as programming language documentation, code repositories, or popular AI platforms for seamless user experiences. Additionally, define the project's scope, objectives, success criteria, and any constraints or assumptions. The revised description also includes considerations for scalability, accessibility, and localization to cater to a global audience.",
