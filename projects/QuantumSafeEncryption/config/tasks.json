    "description": "Prepare a comprehensive document outlining detailed requirements for the Quantum-safe Encryption System. This includes identifying security goals, performance targets, compatibility needs, future upgradability and extensibility considerations, as well as addressing both classical and quantum computing threats. Key areas of focus include key management, encryption/decryption algorithms, data integrity, privacy, and potential attack scenarios. The document should provide clear, concise, and actionable requirements with an emphasis on practicality for real-world application. Additionally, the document should address cross-platform compatibility, scalability, long-term maintainability, and future extensibility of the system. It is crucial to incorporate research on cutting-edge quantum-safe cryptographic techniques. The revised document will serve as a foundation for the project's development and will guide subsequent tasks. Upon completion, the document should be reviewed by both the security specialist and the code-architect before moving forward with implementation. To ensure thoroughness and clarity, the document could also include a section that outlines the project's data flow diagram, user roles and permissions, and any necessary interfaces or integrations. The revised document will then be presented to the project manager for further review and approval.",

This design should be resilient to both classical and quantum computational attacks, taking into account post-quantum cryptography standards such as NIST PQC, SHA-3, and BSIVIT. Consideration should also be given to potential future scalability and security improvements, including the use of blockchain for secure key management. The design should accommodate modularity, allowing for easy integration of new post-quantum cryptographic algorithms.
