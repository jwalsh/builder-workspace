    "description": "Prepare a detailed document outlining comprehensive requirements for the Quantum-safe Encryption System. This includes identifying security goals, performance targets, compatibility needs, future upgradability and extensibility considerations, as well as addressing both classical and quantum computing threats. The document should cover areas such as key management, encryption/decryption algorithms, data integrity, privacy, and potential attack scenarios. It is imperative to ensure that the requirements are clear, concise, and actionable, with an emphasis on practicality for real-world application. Additionally, the document should address cross-platform compatibility, scalability, and long-term maintainability of the system. The revised document will serve as a foundation for the project's development and will be used to guide subsequent tasks. Upon completion, the document should be reviewed and approved by the security specialist before moving forward with implementation.",
