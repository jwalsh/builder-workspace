This includes the AI model, user interface, data storage components, and integration points. The design should prioritize scalability, maintainability, performance requirements, security, and compliance. Outline the high-level components, their responsibilities, interactions, and data flows. Define the technology stack, deployment strategy, and infrastructure requirements. Ensure the architecture supports continuous integration, continuous deployment, and automated testing. Prioritize modularity, extensibility, and adherence to industry best practices. Suggest a plan for error handling, performance optimization, and monitoring. Furthermore, consider edge cases and potential future scalability challenges.",
