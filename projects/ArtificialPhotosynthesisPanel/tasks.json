The design should consider modularity, scalability, maintainability, performance optimization, and error handling. Address potential edge cases, integration with other systems (e.g., energy storage, monitoring, control), safety aspects, environmental impact, and regulatory compliance. The design should also include a clear plan for the integration of research findings from 'Define Project Scope and Requirements' and 'Conduct Research on Artificial Photosynthesis Techniques'.",
