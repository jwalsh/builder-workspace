    "description": "Develop a comprehensive system design for the artificial photosynthesis panels, including the panel structure, materials, components, and their interactions. The design should consider modularity, scalability, maintainability, performance optimization, error handling, and address potential edge cases. Integrate with other systems (e.g., energy storage, monitoring, control), ensuring safety aspects, environmental impact, and regulatory compliance. Incorporate research findings from 'Define Project Scope and Requirements' and 'Conduct Research on Artificial Photosynthesis Techniques'. Break down the design into modular subtasks for efficient development, testing, and deployment. Collaborate with team members to ensure interoperability between components. To facilitate effective collaboration, it is recommended to create a dedicated platform for sharing designs, progress, and discussions. Furthermore, consider creating a prototype or proof-of-concept to validate the design before proceeding with large-scale production.",
