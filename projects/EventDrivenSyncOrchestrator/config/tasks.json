    "description": "Thoroughly revise and expand the requirements gathering for the EventDrivenSyncOrchestrator platform. This involves documenting the types of distributed systems it needs to support (e.g., cloud-based, on-premises, hybrid), detailing synchronization mechanisms such as message brokers (Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ), data replication strategies (Change Data Capture, Streaming Replication), and describing expected performance and scalability requirements (including throughput, latency, and resource utilization). Additionally, outline any necessary integrations with existing systems, consider the security implications of the platform (including authentication via OAuth2 and JWT, Role-Based Access Control, Attribute-Based Access Control, data encryption at rest and in transit, and implementing monitoring and logging mechanisms), specify the use cases and edge cases for the platform to ensure comprehensive coverage, propose a high-level architecture of the system, and break down the project into smaller tasks for development. Also, include a section on error handling and exception scenarios, and consider the impact of data consistency in distributed systems. Lastly, update the project's timeline with milestones and deadlines. Once completed, this task should be assigned to the 'project-manager'.",

The design should adhere to principles of maintainability, modularity, and performance optimizations. Additionally, provide edge case scenarios, error handling mechanisms, discuss potential security implications, suggest suitable technologies for each component, and incorporate the feedback from the Define Project Scope and Requirements task. Include a section for asynchronous processing techniques and considerations, emphasizing the use of message queues and event-driven architectures for efficient and reliable data processing. Upon completion, please update the task to reflect the current state and progress, provide initial wireframes or diagrams, and a detailed explanation of each component's function, potential issues, and solutions. Once complete, update the task to reflect the current state and progress.",
