    "description": "Revise and expand the requirements gathering for the EventDrivenSyncOrchestrator platform. This includes documenting the types of distributed systems it needs to support (e.g., cloud-based, on-premises), detailing synchronization mechanisms such as message brokers or data replication strategies, outlining expected performance and scalability requirements (including throughput, latency, and resource utilization), and specifying any necessary integrations with existing systems. Furthermore, consider the security implications of the platform, including authentication, authorization, and data encryption.",
