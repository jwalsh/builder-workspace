    "description": "This document outlines the comprehensive requirements for the NeuralFirewall project. It covers desired features, performance goals, security standards including GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, integration with existing systems, guidelines for compliance, an approach to real-time threat adaptation using advanced neural network architectures, and future scalability. The following are key aspects of each section:\n\n1. Features:\n   - List of essential features required for the NeuralFirewall system.\n    - Addition of a section for nice-to-have features that would provide additional functionality but are not critical to the core operation of the system, with a brief explanation of their potential impact on system efficiency and user experience.\n2. Performance Goals:\n   - Define measurable performance targets such as response time, throughput, and accuracy in a clear and concise manner, with an emphasis on their impact on system efficiency and user experience.\n3. Security Standards:\n   - Detailed explanation of security standards and relevant regulations (GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA) to be met by the NeuralFirewall system, with specific focus on potential privacy concerns and data protection strategies, including a section discussing penalties for non-compliance and the importance of regular audits and updates.\n4. Integration with Existing Systems:\n   - Description of how the NeuralFirewall system will integrate with existing cybersecurity systems in the current infrastructure, outlining potential challenges and proposed solutions, and an analysis of the expected impact on system performance, including a section discussing the potential risks associated with integration and strategies to mitigate those risks.\n5. Compliance Guidelines:\n   - Procedures and guidelines for maintaining compliance with relevant security standards during development, deployment, and operation, including timelines for regular audits and updates, roles and responsibilities of different team members in ensuring compliance, and a section discussing the importance of continuous monitoring and learning.\n6. Real-time Threat Adaptation Strategy:\n   - Explanation of the neural network architecture approach to adapt in real-time to new threats, including model training, validation, and update strategies, as well as potential limitations and contingency plans, with a discussion on the importance of continuous monitoring and learning, and the need for human oversight.\n7. Future Scalability:\n   - Discussion on how the NeuralFirewall system can be scaled to handle increased data volumes, user bases, or network complexity in the future, including strategies for data partitioning, load balancing, and fault tolerance.",
