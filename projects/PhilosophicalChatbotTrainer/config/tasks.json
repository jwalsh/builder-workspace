    "description": "Detailed requirements for the PhilosophicalChatbotTrainer system are provided below. This includes but is not limited to: philosophical domains coverage (e.g., Existentialism, Stoicism, Platonism), level of discourse (deep and nuanced discussions across various schools of thought), desired functionality (capability to engage in Socratic dialogues, respond to open-ended questions, provide explanations based on philosophical principles), target audience (philosophy enthusiasts, academia, general public interested in philosophy), user interface requirements (intuitive and engaging design, adaptable for web and mobile platforms), integration requirements with existing systems or data sources (PhilPapers API, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy), performance and scalability requirements (handling a high volume of simultaneous conversations while maintaining efficient response times), security and privacy requirements (user data protection, secure storage of philosophical knowledge base), any other relevant constraints or assumptions (limited computational resources for initial deployment, potential future expansion). Additionally, provide a clear outline for task decomposition to facilitate the development process. This revised RFC is now ready for further review and updates.",
