Define the technologies and frameworks to be used. Ensure that the architecture is modular, scalable, and maintainable. Consider the following aspects: 1) Data ingestion from various sources (network devices, probes, etc.) and formats (logs, metrics, structured and unstructured data, etc.). 2) Efficient and scalable data storage and retrieval mechanisms (e.g., distributed file systems, NoSQL databases). 3) Distributed, fault-tolerant, and high-performance analytics engine (e.g., Apache Spark, Apache Flink). 4) Secure and responsive user interface for data visualization, reporting, and interactive analysis (e.g., React, D3.js). 5) Integration with existing systems and tools (e.g., monitoring, logging, alerting). 6) Comprehensive monitoring, logging, and error handling mechanisms. 7) Deployment and scaling strategies (e.g., containerization, orchestration, auto-scaling). 8) Security considerations (e.g., data encryption, access control, auditing). 9) Performance optimizations and tuning. 10) Documentation and knowledge-sharing mechanisms.",
