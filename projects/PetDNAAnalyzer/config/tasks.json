    "description": "This RFC outlines the project's objectives, features, user stories, acceptance criteria for the PetDNAAnalyzer tool. The scope includes defining the system architecture (frontend: UI design & interaction, backend: server-side logic), detailing wireframes or mockups for the user interface, outlining data management strategies (data storage: database design, retrieval: API endpoints, processing methods: algorithms and libraries), specifying necessary security measures (encryption, authentication, authorization, OWASP top 10 considerations), privacy policies (GDPR, CCPA compliance), and third-party API integrations (breed databases, health risk factors APIs). This RFC is in DRAFT state, awaiting further refinement and approval. Once approved, it will be passed on to the task-decomposer for detailed task breakdown.",
