    "description": "1. Gather and document the detailed requirements for the SecureDataLineage system, including data sources (please specify types - both structured and unstructured, such as databases, logs, APIs, etc.), compliance regulations (please list specific ones, for example GDPR, HIPAA, CCPA, etc.), security standards (please mention relevant standards such as OWASP, NIST, ISO 27001, etc.), desired functionality, and non-functional requirements such as performance, scalability, availability, and potential security risks. Also, consider data privacy implications, data protection mechanisms, and incident response plans.\n2. Identify potential integration points with existing systems, if any, and outline the necessary interfaces. Evaluate the impact on existing systems during implementation and post-implementation, taking into account potential changes in system performance, security, and user experience.\n3. Define the data flow and transformations within the system, including data collection, processing, storage, and retrieval methods. Consider data provenance, lineage, and versioning throughout this process. Explore techniques for anonymization and pseudonymization to protect sensitive information.\n4. Collaborate with the appropriate team members to ensure that the defined scope and requirements align with the overall project goals and objectives. This includes but is not limited to data engineers, security specialists, compliance officers, and user experience designers.\n5. Once the requirements are defined and agreed upon, create a comprehensive documentation detailing the system architecture, data model, interfaces, and user interface design.",
