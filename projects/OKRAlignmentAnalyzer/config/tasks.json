    "description": "This RFC proposes to gather and document comprehensive requirements for the OKRAlignmentAnalyzer tool. The requirements will encompass expected features, functionalities, integration with existing systems (specifically mentioning HRIS, project management tools, and analytics platforms), data sources (OKR databases, user input, and system logs), user roles and permissions (admin, manager, employee, guest), security considerations (data encryption, access controls, auditing), performance and scalability requirements, UI/UX design considerations (consistent with our current platform design, mobile responsive, accessible, multilingual support), non-functional requirements (error handling, reliability, maintainability), and any other relevant aspects such as accessibility and internationalization considerations. Additionally, this task aims to establish a clear project scope, set of deliverables, and define success criteria for the project. Furthermore, it is crucial to outline the roadmap for future iterations and potential integrations with other tools or services, focusing on the first version's core functionality while leaving room for expansion in subsequent phases. Lastly, this task requires input from multiple stakeholders across the organization, including HR, project management, IT, and business leaders.",
