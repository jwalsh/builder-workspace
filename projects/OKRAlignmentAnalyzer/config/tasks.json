    "description": "This RFC proposes to gather and document comprehensive requirements for the OKRAlignmentAnalyzer tool. The requirements will include, but are not limited to, expected features, functionalities, integration with existing systems, data sources, user roles and permissions, security considerations, performance and scalability requirements, UI/UX design considerations, and any other relevant aspects such as accessibility and internationalization considerations. Additionally, this task aims to establish a clear project scope, set of deliverables, and define success criteria for the project. Furthermore, it is crucial to outline the roadmap for future iterations and potential integrations with other tools or services.",
