This will include the design of hardware components, software modules, their interactions, and addressing the following aspects: air intake and filtration, dehumidification and condensation, water storage and purification, user interface, power management, connectivity (optional), maintenance and serviceability, safety and fail-safe mechanisms, regulatory compliance. Special attention will be given to energy efficiency, durability, affordability, and ease of use. The design should consider the dependencies 'Gather Requirements' and prioritize accordingly. It is recommended to break down the task into smaller subtasks for easier implementation. Also, consider using modular design principles for future scalability and upgradability. To ensure a comprehensive design, it would be beneficial to involve multi-disciplinary experts such as mechanical engineers, electrical engineers, software developers, and UI/UX designers. The design documentation should include detailed diagrams, flowcharts, and prototypes.",

Include guidelines for secure design principles, encryption methods (AES-256, RSA), access control mechanisms (user authentication, authorization, and accountability), and industry-standard best practices for securing similar devices (such as OWASP IoT Top 10). Provide recommendations on regular security updates and patch management. Highlight the importance of secure-by-design approach and defense-in-depth strategy. Suggest integrating vulnerability scanning tools and penetration testing into the development process from early stages, not just during final testing. If necessary, propose additional measures to mitigate emerging threats such as AI-based threat detection and response systems. Upon completion, perform a security audit to verify the effectiveness of implemented measures. Update this RFC with the findings and suggested improvements based on the audit. Provide documentation for the implemented security solutions to facilitate future maintenance and updates.",
