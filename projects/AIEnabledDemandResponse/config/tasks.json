This design will follow best practices for modularity, maintainability, and testability. Adopt microservices, event-driven architecture, and cloud-native technologies while ensuring compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and other data privacy requirements. Collaborate with relevant team members such as data scientists, UX/UI designers, and DevOps engineers in the design process. Implement monitoring and logging strategies, and provide a timeline for completion of this task. Upon completion, provide documentation for the technical team (Technical Writer). Update the architecture design to ensure it is flexible enough to accommodate future enhancements or changes. Submit the updated design for review by the Project Manager and Technical Lead (Task Decomposer) before deployment. In case of any unforeseen dependencies, re-evaluate the priority and dependencies accordingly.",
