This should include user registration, login, password management, role-based access control, data encryption at rest and in transit, secure communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS), and security best practices such as input validation, output encoding, and protection against common web vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, CSRF, SQL injection). Additionally, consider implementing multi-factor authentication for admin users and review the necessity of implementing Single Sign On (SSO) in this project's scope. The security specialist will be responsible for ensuring compliance with these measures. Update the design system architecture to accommodate these security measures. Depend on the completion of 'Design System Architecture' and 'Define User Roles and Permissions'.",
