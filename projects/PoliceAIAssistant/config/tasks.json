    "description": "Update the functional and non-functional requirements for the PoliceAIAssistant. This includes a detailed list of expected features (e.g., real-time crime data analysis, legal guidance, situation assessment), use cases (e.g., traffic stops, emergency situations), performance criteria (such as response time under 3 seconds, data handling capacity to manage up to 10,000 requests per minute), security and privacy considerations (including AES encryption for data at rest and TLS for data in transit, user authentication via biometrics or two-factor authentication, data retention policies that comply with GDPR, CCPA, and Blue Code of Silence, secure data storage solutions like AWS or Azure, regular security audits), integration with existing police systems (APIs or SDKs like NCIC, NLETS, and State Law Enforcement Telecommunications System), and compliance with relevant legal/regulatory requirements. Also, consider the potential impact on user experience and usability, accessibility concerns, and address any accessibility issues. Additionally, specify the interface design (UI/UX) for a seamless user interaction. Lastly, outline a plan for continuous improvement and updates based on user feedback and technological advancements.",
