    "description": "Design and implement a scalable, secure, high-performance data management and storage system for EternalFanExperience. The system should support efficient data retrieval, backup, and archiving mechanisms, ensuring compliance with data privacy and security regulations. Consider using a hybrid approach of relational (e.g., PostgreSQL for structured data) and NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB for semi-structured and unstructured data). Implement caching mechanisms (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed data. Develop a data partitioning and sharding strategy (e.g., Horizontal Partitioning, Consistent Hashing) for horizontal scalability. Implement robust data backup and disaster recovery mechanisms (e.g., daily backups, regular system snapshots, geo-replication). Ensure data integrity and consistency through transactions and locking mechanisms (ACID compliance). Develop a data access layer with APIs for secure and efficient data access. Optimize the design for future expansion and evolution. Incorporate monitoring and alerting tools to detect and address performance issues, and to ensure system availability. Consider using containerization (e.g., Docker) for easier deployment and scaling. Additionally, consider implementing a version control system for database schema management, automatic index maintenance, and potential machine learning integrations in the future. Update the system for potential AI-driven virtual avatars interactions data requirements. If possible, explore the use of graph databases (e.g., Neo4j) to model complex relationships between entertainment figures and their interactions. After reviewing and refining the design, update this RFC to 'READY_FOR_IMPLEMENTATION' state. Suggested improvements: 1. Clearly define the data model for AI-driven virtual avatars, focusing on how they interact with fans and how their behavior evolves over time. This will help guide the database design and ensure compatibility with future updates and expansions. 2. Consider implementing a distributed cache (e.g., Hazelcast) to improve scalability and reduce the load on individual instances of Redis. 3. Investigate the use of serverless databases (e.g., AWS DynamoDB, Google Cloud Spanner) for certain parts of the system that require high availability and auto-scaling.",
