The system should support efficient data retrieval, backup, and archiving mechanisms. Ensure compliance with data privacy and security regulations. Consider using a hybrid approach of relational (e.g., PostgreSQL for structured data) and NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB for semi-structured and unstructured data). Implement caching mechanisms (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed data. Develop a data partitioning and sharding strategy (e.g., Horizontal Partitioning, Consistent Hashing) for horizontal scalability. Implement robust data backup and disaster recovery mechanisms (e.g., daily backups, regular system snapshots, geo-replication). Ensure data integrity and consistency through transactions and locking mechanisms (e.g., ACID compliance). Develop a data access layer with APIs for secure and efficient data access. Optimize the design for future expansion and evolution. Incorporate monitoring and alerting tools to detect and address performance issues, and to ensure system availability.",
