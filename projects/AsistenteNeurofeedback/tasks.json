The strategy should address the following key aspects: \n1. Version control for easy management of changes and updates.\n2. Automated testing to ensure quality and stability.\n3. Containerization using Docker or Kubernetes for portability and scalability.\n4. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using tools like Terraform or AWS CloudFormation for efficient and consistent infrastructure provisioning.\n5. Monitoring and logging using tools such as Prometheus, Grafana, or ELK stack to monitor application performance and diagnose issues quickly.\n6. Security measures including secure coding practices, encryption, and intrusion detection systems.",
