    "description": "Detailed breakdown of the requirements for the ValueStreamAlignmentOptimizer system:\n1. Document the definition of value streams, including key activities and entities involved.\n2. Define alignment criteria that can be used to measure the efficiency of activities along a value stream, considering factors such as cycle time, resource allocation, and resource utilization.\n3. Establish optimization goals (e.g., increase overall throughput, reduce lead time, minimize waste), and set quantifiable targets for each goal.\n4. Incorporate feedback from stakeholders and domain experts, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of their needs and concerns.\n5. Document assumptions and potential risks associated with the project, outlining mitigation strategies and contingency plans.\n6. Identify key performance indicators (KPIs) to monitor progress and success of the system throughout its lifecycle.",
