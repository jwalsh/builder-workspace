    "description": "This RFC outlines all necessary requirements for the LegalAIAssistant project. The scope includes: - Case law analysis module: Ability to analyze, categorize, and summarize case law based on keywords, jurisdictions, and relevant legal concepts (consider integrating with popular legal research platforms like Westlaw or LexisNexis). - Document drafting tool: Automated document creation featuring customizable templates, predictive text suggestions, and integrations with commonly used legal formatting standards, as well as the ability to extract key details from case law and client input (consider developing a feature for collaborative editing between lawyers and paralegals). - Initial legal advice feature: AI-powered feature to provide initial legal opinions based on case law analysis and user input, with clear disclaimers emphasizing that the opinions are not binding or comprehensive (it may be beneficial to have this reviewed by a legal professional during implementation). - Compliance with data privacy regulations: Ensuring adherence to GDPR, HIPAA, and other relevant regulations in data handling and storage. - Interface design guidelines (UX/UI): Providing a user-friendly interface for lawyers, ensuring ease of navigation, efficient workflows, and accessibility, focusing on the needs of lawyers with diverse abilities (consider incorporating accessibility best practices as per WCAG 2.1 standards). - Integration with common legal software systems: Seamless integration with popular legal software such as Clio, MyCase, and LawyerLogix, as well as providing APIs for custom integrations. - Performance and scalability requirements: Ensuring the system can handle large volumes of data and maintain high performance levels by optimizing database queries and implementing caching strategies. - Security considerations and best practices: Implementing encryption, two-factor authentication, and regular security audits to protect client data, as well as conducting vulnerability assessments and penetration testing. - User stories: Detailed descriptions of how each feature is used by different user roles (e.g., lawyers, paralegals, administrators), with examples of edge cases and scenarios that might challenge the system. - Project timeline: Providing a realistic project timeline with key milestones and deadlines.",
