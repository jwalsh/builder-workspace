    "title": "Define Project Requirements and Scope - RFC Review",
    "description": "This RFC outlines the functionalities, user requirements, technical specifications, and constraints for the NeuralNetworkSimulationPlatform. It includes detailed descriptions of expected features (such as support for various neural network architectures, customizable visualization options, and interactive simulation), performance standards (e.g., real-time simulation speeds and scalability to large datasets), technology choices (utilizing modern libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch for machine learning, and Three.js or WebGL for 3D visualization), potential challenges (e.g., memory management, data privacy, and security concerns), and suggestions for addressing these challenges. It is designed to serve as a guide for further development and to ensure the platform meets the needs of its intended users. This RFC also includes sections on user research findings, accessibility standards, and integration with other tools and platforms. The RFC provides a comprehensive overview of the project requirements and scope, acting as a reference point for all involved in the development process. However, it may be beneficial to include more details about specific features, such as the ability to import custom neural network architectures or the level of interaction expected in the visualization component. Additionally, consider specifying the minimum hardware and software requirements for running the platform. This RFC is currently in DRAFT state, ready for further review and refinement.",
