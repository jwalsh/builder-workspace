Define interfaces between different components and data flow. Consider scalability, security, and performance requirements. Provide a high-level overview of the architecture, detailed designs for critical components (emphasizing areas such as privacy and ethical considerations), ensure compatibility with existing systems (e.g., APIs). The design should include strategies for integrating user privacy and ethical considerations throughout the system. Break down complex components into smaller tasks if necessary. Upon completion, review the design with project stakeholders.",
