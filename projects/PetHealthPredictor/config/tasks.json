    "title": "Define Comprehensive Scope and Requirements for PetHealthPredictor System",
    "description": "Develop a detailed list of requirements for the PetHealthPredictor system, including potential pet health issues (e.g., obesity, diabetes, allergies), various data sources (smart collars, home sensors, veterinary records, owner-reported symptoms, pet nutrition providers, veterinary databases, third-party diagnostic tools), and expected system outputs (recommendations, alerts, reports). Establish guidelines for data privacy and security, including compliance with relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA). Clarify system scalability considerations, considering potential future expansion of supported pets and health issues. Include user experience design considerations to ensure the system is intuitive, accessible, and easy to use for pet owners. Provide clear documentation, including technical requirements, wireframes, and user stories, with a focus on usability for both pet owners and veterinarians. Address potential edge cases and provide contingency plans in case of data inconsistencies or unexpected system behavior. Update the API design to ensure compatibility with future expansions, and include error handling mechanisms to minimize downtime and maximize system availability. Ensure the system's architecture is modular and scalable for seamless integration with third-party services.",
