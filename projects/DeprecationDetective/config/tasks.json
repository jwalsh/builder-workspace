    "description": "Update the detailed requirements for the DeprecationDetective system as follows: \n* The types of codebases it should support (e.g., monolithic, microservices): Include support for serverless architectures as well.\n* The programming languages and frameworks to be covered (specify versions where necessary): Initially focus on the top 5 popular languages (Java, Python, JavaScript, Ruby, PHP) and their common frameworks. Version specifications should cover latest LTS releases.\n* The desired level of accuracy and performance: Strive for a precision rate of over 90% with a maximum response time of less than 10 seconds for individual code scans.\n* User experience expectations such as UI/UX design and integration with IDEs or CI/CD tools: Design a simple, user-friendly web interface that integrates seamlessly with popular IDEs (Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse) and continuous integration tools (Jenkins, Travis CI).\n* Edge cases that should be considered for deprecated code detection: Account for obscure or rarely used deprecated APIs, libraries, and dependencies.\n* Key stakeholders and their specific needs within this project: Identify software developers, DevOps engineers, and technical leads as the primary stakeholders. Developers require a tool to help them maintain clean and up-to-date codebases, while DevOps engineers need assistance in automating deprecated code detection during deployment processes.",
