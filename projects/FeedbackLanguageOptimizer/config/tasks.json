    "description": "Updated requirements definition for the FeedbackLanguageOptimizer tool, including: features (e.g., sentiment analysis, bias detection, grammar correction), target users (developers, content creators, and reviewers), anticipated outcomes (constructive, unbiased, and grammatically correct feedback), potential constraints or assumptions (data privacy and security, cultural sensitivity), necessary integrations or interoperability considerations (APIs for existing feedback systems, potentially including popular IDEs and project management tools), and clear use cases demonstrating the utility of the tool. Additionally, specify any special considerations for AI-based tools such as training data sources (a diverse and large dataset to minimize bias), model transparency (providing explanations for the tool's decisions), ethical guidelines (ensuring fairness, accountability, and respect for user autonomy), and potential mitigation strategies for misuse or errors. Lastly, consider incorporating a feedback mechanism for users to rate the tool's performance and suggest improvements. If possible, provide an initial roadmap for the project's development phases. Please note that while the project prioritization remains at 5, it would be beneficial to reassess this based on the project's progress and dependencies. Upon completion of this task, kindly update the rfc_state field to 'IMPLEMENTATION'.",
