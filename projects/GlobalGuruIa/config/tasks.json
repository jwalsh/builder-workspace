This task includes creating a secure registration flow, user account activation, password recovery, and two-factor authentication. Additionally, consider integrating with existing identity providers such as Google, Facebook, and LinkedIn to streamline the user registration process. To ensure compatibility with future system enhancements, utilize industry-standard libraries for authentication such as Passport.js or JWT. Furthermore, prioritize user privacy and security by adhering to best practices like OAuth 2.0.",
