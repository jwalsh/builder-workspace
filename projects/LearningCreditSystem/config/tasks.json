    "description": "This task aims to revise and update the requirements for the LearningCreditSystem. Detailed user stories, functional requirements, non-functional requirements, constraints, assumptions, and relevant stakeholder inputs will be created. Key actors and their roles will be identified, system boundaries defined, expected behavior and interactions specified, considering scalability, performance, security, accessibility, and compatibility with existing systems. The long-term maintenance and updates of the system will also be considered, along with outlining a data model for storing employee information, learning courses, skills, and credits allocation. Acceptance criteria for each user story will be included. Additionally, the task includes updating the software architecture diagram to reflect the new requirements.",
