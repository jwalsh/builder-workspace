This includes creating detailed user stories, functional requirements, non-functional requirements, constraints, assumptions, and any relevant stakeholder inputs. Identify key actors and their roles, define system boundaries, specify the expected behavior and interactions, consider scalability, performance, security, accessibility requirements, and ensure compatibility with existing systems where applicable. Also, consider the long-term maintenance and updates of the system. In addition, outline the data model for storing employee information, learning courses, skills, and credits allocation. Lastly, include acceptance criteria for each user story.",
