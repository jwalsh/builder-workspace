    "title": "Define Project Scope and Requirements - Updated",
    "description": "This task aims to gather, document, and refine the project requirements with greater detail. The focus is on the following aspects: specific workload types (e.g., cloud-native applications, virtual machines, databases, and their versions), desired level of data protection (e.g., backup frequency, retention period, and recovery point objectives), any specific compliance or regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, and relevant clauses), potential integration points with existing systems, a list of assumed, constrained, and risk factors associated with the project, an overview of the data protection strategy to be used, its impact on system performance, and expected performance metrics. The documentation should also include clear definitions of terms and abbreviations for easy understanding. In addition, it is crucial to specify any dependencies, potential roadblocks or challenges, and potential solutions. If necessary, consider breaking down the task into smaller subtasks to facilitate effective delegation and progress tracking. Once completed, the document will serve as a guide for the successful implementation of BackupFortress. The document should also provide an estimate of the timeline for completion of each requirement, and any tools or resources required for the task. It would be beneficial to engage with relevant stakeholders during this process for input and validation. If necessary, consider seeking additional expertise from technical writers for clarity and conciseness in documentation.",
