The design focuses on a modular, scalable, and maintainable structure with an emphasis on best practices for containerized applications, particularly security aspects. Adhering to industry-standard principles such as Defense in Depth and Least Privilege will be prioritized throughout the design process. Key components include the Scanner Engine, Vulnerability Database, User Interface, and Integration Layer. Data flow, integration points, and security considerations are detailed below.",
