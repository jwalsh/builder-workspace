This includes: types of data to be monitored (e.g., CPU usage, memory consumption, network traffic, log analysis, error rates, response times), desired visualizations (e.g., graphs, charts, tables, heatmaps, timelines), target users (e.g., system administrators, IT managers, developers, DevOps engineers), and any additional features requested by stakeholders (e.g., alerting systems, anomaly detection). The gathered requirements will serve as a foundation for the subsequent development phases. Also, consider incorporating suggestions from the ObservabilityDashboard Discord channel to ensure diverse perspectives are taken into account.",
