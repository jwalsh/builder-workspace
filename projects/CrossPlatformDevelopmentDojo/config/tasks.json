    "description": "Revised requirements for the CrossPlatformDevelopmentDojo project, including target platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, iOS), devices, development techniques (React Native, Flutter, Xamarin, PWA and native mobile technologies such as Swift/Objective-C for iOS and Java/Kotlin for Android), learning objectives (theory, practical exercises, real-world examples, and case studies), and catering to a diverse audience (beginners, intermediates, advanced developers). The challenges will be varied in complexity, focusing on both theoretical concepts and hands-on exercises. Incorporating best practices for cross-platform development and optimizing performance across different platforms will also be considered.",
