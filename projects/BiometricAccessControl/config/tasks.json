    "title": "System Architecture Design for Biometric Access Control System",
    "description": "Design the overall architecture of the biometric access control system, including components for facial recognition, fingerprint scanning, iris scanning, and access control management. Define data flows, interfaces, integration points, and security considerations. Address scalability, performance, fault tolerance, maintainability aspects, as well as data privacy and compliance requirements. Emphasize on modularity, extensibility, and ease of integration with third-party systems. Provide detailed documentation for each component. Include a section for potential future improvements such as voice recognition or gait analysis. Ensure the design follows best practices for accessibility and usability. To ensure a robust implementation, consider dividing this task into smaller subtasks based on system components for easier management and tracking of progress. For a more efficient development process, assign the following subtasks to specific team members: 1. Facial Recognition System Design - Assigned to: frontend-developer 2. Fingerprint Scanning System Design - Assigned to: backend-developer 3. Iris Scanning System Design - Assigned to: database-specialist 4. Access Control Management System Design - Assigned to: code-architect 5. Security Considerations and Data Privacy Compliance - Assigned to: security-specialist 6. Documentation - Assigned to: technical-writer 7. Performance, Scalability, Fault Tolerance, and Maintainability Considerations - Assigned to: devops-engineer 8. Integration with Third-Party Systems - Assigned to: frontend-developer/backend-developer as needed. This task decomposition will facilitate parallel development, reduce bottlenecks, and improve overall project progress. Once each subtask is complete, consolidate the design for a comprehensive system architecture document. It would also be beneficial to include a section in the architecture document that discusses error handling strategies, especially in situations where multiple biometric factors may not match or are inconsistent.",
