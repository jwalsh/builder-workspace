    "title": "Define Project Scope and Requirements",
    "description": "Gather and document the requirements for the PureGraphProcessingEngine, including target use cases (e.g., graph analytics, machine learning), performance goals (such as latency, throughput, and memory usage), expected features (graph traversal algorithms, graph visualization), non-functional requirements such as scalability, maintainability, security considerations (including data privacy and protection), error handling, logging, monitoring, and testing strategies. Collaborate with team members to ensure comprehensive coverage of requirements, emphasizing the importance of clear and concise documentation for each requirement. As a code-architect, I suggest considering the potential impact on design patterns and architectural decisions. For instance, consider implementing a service-oriented architecture (SOA) or microservices approach, as it could lead to improved scalability, maintainability, and flexibility. Additionally, discuss performance optimization strategies, error recovery mechanisms, and integration with existing systems. Update the project documentation accordingly. Once complete, seek feedback from team members, particularly the project manager and relevant specialists (e.g., database-specialist, devops-engineer, security-specialist, technical-writer). When revisions have been incorporated, update the rfc_state to 'READY_FOR_REVIEW'.",

The focus will be on outlining the core components, data structures, and algorithms suitable for large-scale data analysis with an emphasis on functional purity and immutability. The design should also address scalability, efficiency, and fault tolerance to handle large volumes of data effectively. Additionally, this task will specify performance metrics and considerations, along with potential integration points with other systems.",
