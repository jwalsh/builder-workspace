    "description": "Gather and document the requirements for the PureGraphProcessingEngine, including the target use cases (e.g., graph analytics, machine learning, etc.), performance goals (such as latency, throughput, and memory usage), expected features (graph traversal algorithms, graph visualization, etc.), non-functional requirements such as scalability, maintainability, security considerations (including data privacy and protection), error handling, logging, and monitoring. Collaborate with team members to ensure comprehensive coverage of requirements, emphasizing the importance of clear and concise documentation for each requirement. As a code-architect, I suggest considering the potential impact on design patterns and architectural decisions. For instance, consider how we might implement a service-oriented architecture or microservices approach, as it could lead to improved scalability, maintainability, and flexibility. Update the project documentation accordingly.",
