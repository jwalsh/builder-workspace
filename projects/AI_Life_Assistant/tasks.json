The design should emphasize scalability, security, performance optimization, maintainability, usability, and accessibility. Consider microservices or serverless architecture for better scalability and maintainability, incorporate security best practices, and plan for performance optimizations (caching, load balancing, asynchronous processing). Discuss the need for testing methodologies (unit tests, integration tests, system tests) and quality assurance processes during development and deployment. Use agile methodologies for iterative development and continuous delivery/integration. Provide a detailed design document outlining high-level architecture, individual component designs, and interfaces between components. Include a roadmap for implementation and timelines. Investigate the use of containerization technologies (Docker or Kubernetes) for deployment flexibility and portability. Also, consider machine learning techniques to improve AI's decision-making capabilities. Finally, discuss potential benefits and requirements for real-time data processing and edge computing in specific use cases.",
