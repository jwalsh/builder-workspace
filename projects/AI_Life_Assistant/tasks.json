    "description": "Design the overall system architecture, including components, data flow, integration points, and key considerations like scalability, security, performance optimization, and maintainability. The architecture should follow a modular and layered approach, separating concerns such as user interface, business logic, data access, and external integrations. Ensure proper error handling, logging, and monitoring mechanisms are in place. Consider using microservices or serverless architecture for better scalability and maintainability. Incorporate security best practices like authentication, authorization, data encryption, and input validation. Plan for performance optimizations such as caching, load balancing, and asynchronous processing where applicable, also consider edge cases, and implement strategies to handle them gracefully. Discuss the need for testing methodologies and quality assurance processes during the development and deployment phases.",
