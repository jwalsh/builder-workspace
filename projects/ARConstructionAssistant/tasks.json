    "title": "System Architecture Design",
    "description": "Design the overall system architecture, including components, data flows, and integration points. The architecture should consider the following key aspects:\n\n1. Device compatibility: The system should support various AR-enabled devices (e.g., smartphones, tablets, AR headsets) and handle different hardware capabilities. Consider a modular design that separates device-specific logic from core functionality. Provide clear interfaces for device integration and consider using platform-specific SDKs where necessary.\n\n2. Data management: Implement a centralized data storage solution (e.g., cloud-based database) for construction data and user data. Ensure data integrity, backup, and recovery mechanisms. Consider implementing data versioning for collaboration purposes and data archiving for long-term retention.\n\n3. Real-time data processing: Utilize edge computing or serverless architectures for low-latency processing of sensor data. Offload computationally intensive tasks to cloud resources as needed. Implement data streaming solutions for continuous data transfer between edge devices and the cloud, considering technologies like Kafka or MQTT.\n\n4. Scalability and performance: Adopt a microservices architecture with load balancing and auto-scaling capabilities. Use containerization technologies (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes) for improved deployment flexibility and resource management. Implement caching and content delivery networks (CDNs) for improved performance, considering solutions like Redis or Cloudflare.\n\n5. Integration with existing systems: Expose APIs or use industry-standard protocols (e.g., IFC, BCF) for integration with construction management software, BIM tools, and other relevant systems. Provide clear documentation on API usage and versioning, considering using OpenAPI Specification (OAS).\n\n6. Security and privacy: Implement secure authentication and authorization mechanisms using OAuth or similar standards. Encrypt data in transit (TLS/SSL) and at rest using industry-standard encryption methods like AES-256. Adhere to relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA), implementing data anonymization techniques where necessary. Perform regular security audits and penetration testing.\n\n7. Offline mode: Consider supporting an offline mode for situations with limited or no internet connectivity, with local data caching and synchronization mechanisms using technologies like PouchDB or IndexedDB, as well as implementing offline-first design principles.\n\n8. Extensibility and maintainability: Design a modular and extensible architecture that allows for easy integration of new features, devices, and data sources. Follow industry best practices for code organization, documentation, and testing, considering using tools like Git and Sphinx.\n\n9. Error handling and edge cases: Implement proper error handling mechanisms to ensure graceful degradation in case of errors or failures. Consider using techniques like circuit breakers or retry policies for resilience, as well as implementing robust exception handling strategies.\n\n10. Monitoring and logging: Implement monitoring and logging solutions for continuous system health checks, performance metrics, and troubleshooting purposes, considering tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or Splunk.\n\nUpdate the rfc_state field to 'APPROVED' once the changes are satisfactory.",
