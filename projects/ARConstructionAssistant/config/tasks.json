    "project_id": "ARConstructionAssistant",
    "title": "System Architecture Design",
    "description": "Design the overall system architecture, including components, data flows, and integration points. The architecture should consider the following key aspects:\n\n1. Device compatibility: The system should support various AR-enabled devices (e.g., smartphones, tablets, AR headsets) and handle different hardware capabilities. Consider a modular design that separates device-specific logic from core functionality. Provide clear interfaces for device integration and consider using platform-specific SDKs where necessary.\n\n2. Data management: Implement a centralized data storage solution (e.g., cloud-based database) for construction data and user data. Ensure data integrity, backup, and recovery mechanisms. Consider implementing data versioning for collaboration purposes and data archiving for long-term retention. Additionally, consider using serverless architectures or databases that automatically replicate data across multiple availability zones to improve fault tolerance.\n\n3. Real-time data processing: Utilize edge computing for low-latency processing of sensor data, offloading computationally intensive tasks to cloud resources as needed. Implement data streaming solutions for continuous data transfer between edge devices and the cloud, considering technologies like Kafka or MQTT. Also, consider implementing real-time analytics using tools such as Apache Flink or AWS Kinesis Data Analytics for actionable insights.\n\n4. Scalability and performance: Adopt a microservices architecture with load balancing and auto-scaling capabilities. Use containerization technologies (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes) for improved deployment flexibility and resource management. Implement caching and content delivery networks (CDNs) for improved performance, considering solutions like Redis or Cloudflare. Moreover, consider using managed services like AWS Elastic Beanstalk or Google App Engine to easily scale your application.\n\n5. Integration with existing systems: Expose APIs or use industry-standard protocols (e.g., IFC, BCF) for integration with construction management software, BIM tools, and other relevant systems. Provide clear documentation on API usage and versioning, considering using OpenAPI Specification (OAS). Also, consider implementing webhooks for real-time event-driven communication between services.\n\n6. Security and privacy: Implement secure authentication and authorization mechanisms using OAuth or similar standards. Encrypt data in transit (TLS/SSL) and at rest using industry-standard encryption methods like AES-256. Adhere to relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA), implementing data anonymization techniques where necessary. Perform regular security audits and penetration testing, and consider implementing security automation tools like OWASP ZAP or AWS Inspector.\n\n7. Offline mode: Consider supporting an offline mode for situations with limited or no internet connectivity, with local data caching and synchronization mechanisms using technologies like PouchDB or IndexedDB, as well as implementing offline-first design principles. Also, consider using sync gateways to synchronize data between the client and the server when connectivity is restored.\n\n8. Extensibility and maintainability: Design a modular and extensible architecture that allows for easy integration of new features, devices, and data sources. Follow industry best practices for code organization, documentation, and testing, considering using tools like Git and Sphinx. Additionally, consider implementing continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) pipelines to automate the building, testing, and deployment process.\n\n9. Error handling and edge cases: Implement proper error handling mechanisms to ensure graceful degradation in case of errors or failures. Consider using techniques like circuit breakers for improved resilience.\n\n10. Documentation: Ensure that all components, interfaces, and APIs have comprehensive documentation. This includes clear instructions on how to use them, potential issues, and any dependencies.\n\nI suggest updating the 'rfc_state' field to 'reviewed' as the RFC is ready for further review by a code-architect or other technical experts.",

The design should also account for potential hardware limitations such as processing power and battery life, optimizing the user experience accordingly. Additionally, ensure that the design is flexible enough to accommodate future updates and improvements in technology. Seek input from construction workers and other stakeholders during the design process, including testing phases for usability and accessibility. After feedback and iterations, integrate the design with the Core Functionality Development (when completed) and Hardware Selection and Integration tasks.
