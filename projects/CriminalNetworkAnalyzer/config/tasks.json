    "description": "Gather and document the detailed requirements for the CriminalNetworkAnalyzer system. This includes specifying data sources (open source, proprietary, real-time, historical), analysis techniques (machine learning, network analysis, pattern recognition), user interface (dashboard, API), output formats (visualizations, raw data, reports), security and privacy considerations (anonymization, encryption, access controls, incident response plan), scalability and performance requirements, integration with existing systems (APIs, webhooks), compliance with relevant laws and regulations (GDPR, CCPA, data retention policies), definition of use cases and user stories to guide development, and documentation of these requirements for the technical team. Additionally, consider defining the expected system response time, error handling mechanisms, and disaster recovery strategies.",

    "title": "Design System Architecture",
    "description": "Design the overall architecture of the system, including components, data flow, integration points, scalability considerations, security measures, and performance optimizations. The architecture should consider the following key aspects:\n\n1. Data ingestion and processing pipeline: Define the components and flow for ingesting and processing large volumes of structured and unstructured data from various sources.\n\n2. Data storage and management: Determine the appropriate data storage solutions (e.g., relational databases, NoSQL databases, data lakes) based on the data types, volumes, and access patterns. Additionally, consider implementing a system for real-time stream processing for immediate insights from incoming data.\n\n3. Data analysis and modeling: Specify the components and techniques for analyzing the data, building predictive models, and mapping criminal networks. This should include machine learning algorithms, network analysis methods, and statistical modeling techniques.\n\n4. User interface and visualization: Design the user interface and visualization components for presenting the analyzed data and criminal network maps in an intuitive and interactive manner. Consider implementing a dynamic dashboard for real-time monitoring of the system's insights and trends.\n\n5. Integration and interoperability: Identify potential integration points with external systems or data sources, and define the necessary interfaces and protocols. This should include APIs for data exchange and webhooks for event-based integrations.\n\n6. Scalability and performance: Incorporate strategies for horizontal and vertical scaling, load balancing, caching, and other performance optimizations to handle large data volumes and high concurrency. Implement a microservices architecture to ensure scalability and maintainability. Consider implementing an event-driven architecture (EDA) to handle real-time stream processing and data pipelines.\n\n7. Security and compliance: Implement robust security measures, such as data encryption, access controls, auditing, and compliance with relevant regulations (e.g., data privacy laws). Ensure that the system adheres to OWASP standards for secure software development and follows best practices for securing machine learning models.\n\n8. Monitoring and logging: Establish mechanisms for monitoring system health, performance, and logging for troubleshooting and auditing purposes. Implement a centralized logging solution like Elasticsearch or Splunk for easy access and analysis. Consider implementing observability tools like Prometheus for metrics collection and Grafana for visualization.\n\n9. Documentation: Create comprehensive documentation for the system architecture, including design decisions, implementation details, and usage guidelines. Maintain a living documentation repository that is easily accessible to all team members.\n\n10. Testing and Quality Assurance: Develop a testing strategy and plan for ensuring the quality of the system, including unit tests, integration tests, performance tests, and security vulnerability scans. Consider using tools like Selenium, Pytest, or JMeter for testing.",
