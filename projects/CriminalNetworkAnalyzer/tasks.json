This includes specifying data sources (open source, proprietary, real-time, historical), analysis techniques (machine learning, network analysis, pattern recognition), user interface (dashboard, API), output formats (visualizations, raw data, reports), security and privacy considerations (anonymization, encryption, access controls), scalability and performance requirements, integration with existing systems (APIs, webhooks), compliance with relevant laws and regulations (GDPR, CCPA), and documentation of these requirements for the technical team. Additionally, define use cases and user stories to guide development.",

    "description": "Design the overall architecture of the system, including components, data flow, integration points, scalability considerations, security measures, and performance optimizations. The architecture should consider the following key aspects:\n\n1. Data ingestion and processing pipeline: Define the components and flow for ingesting and processing large volumes of structured and unstructured data from various sources.\n\n2. Data storage and management: Determine the appropriate data storage solutions (e.g., relational databases, NoSQL databases, data lakes) based on the data types, volumes, and access patterns.\n\n3. Data analysis and modeling: Specify the components and techniques for analyzing the data, building predictive models, and mapping criminal networks.\n\n4. User interface and visualization: Design the user interface and visualization components for presenting the analyzed data and criminal network maps in an intuitive and interactive manner.\n\n5. Integration and interoperability: Identify potential integration points with external systems or data sources, and define the necessary interfaces and protocols.\n\n6. Scalability and performance: Incorporate strategies for horizontal and vertical scaling, load balancing, caching, and other performance optimizations to handle large data volumes and high concurrency.\n\n7. Security and compliance: Implement robust security measures, such as data encryption, access controls, auditing, and compliance with relevant regulations (e.g., data privacy laws).\n\n8. Monitoring and logging: Establish mechanisms for monitoring system health, performance, and logging for troubleshooting and auditing purposes.",
