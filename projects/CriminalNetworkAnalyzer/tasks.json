    "description": "Design the overall architecture of the system, including components, data flow, integration points, scalability considerations, security measures, and performance optimizations. The architecture should consider the following key aspects:\n\n1. Data ingestion and processing pipeline: Define the components and flow for ingesting and processing large volumes of structured and unstructured data from various sources.\n\n2. Data storage and management: Determine the appropriate data storage solutions (e.g., relational databases, NoSQL databases, data lakes) based on the data types, volumes, and access patterns.\n\n3. Data analysis and modeling: Specify the components and techniques for analyzing the data, building predictive models, and mapping criminal networks.\n\n4. User interface and visualization: Design the user interface and visualization components for presenting the analyzed data and criminal network maps in an intuitive and interactive manner.\n\n5. Integration and interoperability: Identify potential integration points with external systems or data sources, and define the necessary interfaces and protocols.\n\n6. Scalability and performance: Incorporate strategies for horizontal and vertical scaling, load balancing, caching, and other performance optimizations to handle large data volumes and high concurrency.\n\n7. Security and compliance: Implement robust security measures, such as data encryption, access controls, auditing, and compliance with relevant regulations (e.g., data privacy laws).\n\n8. Monitoring and logging: Establish mechanisms for monitoring system health, performance, and logging for troubleshooting and auditing purposes.",
