    "description": "Detailed documentation of the AI Tactical Advisor system requirements:\n\t* Data inputs: sensor data, intelligence reports, terrain maps, weather conditions, etc.\n\t* Expected outputs: tactical recommendations, risk assessments, resource allocation plans, situational awareness reports\n\t* Performance criteria: real-time response (< 1 second latency), accuracy (over 90% for tactical recommendations, 85% for risk assessments and resource allocation plans), scalability to support up to 100 concurrent connections, adaptability to dynamic battlefield conditions, reliability under stress (99.9% uptime)\n\t* Integration with existing military systems: command and control systems, communication networks, logistics management systems, drone control systems\n\t* Security considerations: data privacy (compliance with GDPR or equivalent standards), cybersecurity measures (encryption, secure communication channels), threat modeling, access controls, incident response plan, vulnerability assessments, penetration testing, security audits\n\t* Documentation of software architecture, APIs, UI/UX design, and database structure (if applicable)\n\t* Performance testing and benchmarking to ensure the system meets the defined criteria\n\t* Project milestones: initial prototype completion, integration with military systems, user acceptance testing (UAT), deployment\n\t* Additional considerations for this task:\n\t\t- Clearly define the AI models and algorithms to be used for data analysis and prediction.\n\t\t- Include a section on system monitoring and logging for troubleshooting purposes.\n\t\t- Consider edge computing or decentralized solutions for real-time data processing, if applicable.\n   \t\t- Add emphasis on the need for the system to handle high-stress environments (e.g., battlefield situations) and the implications of system downtime.\n\t\t- Provide a clear roadmap for the development process, including key deliverables and timelines.\n\n   If the RFC is ready for approval, please update the 'rfc_state' field to 'READY_FOR_APPROVAL'.",
