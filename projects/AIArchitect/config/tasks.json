    "description": "Gather and document the comprehensive requirements for the AIArchitect system. The requirements should include input formats (structured data, programming languages, supporting files), desired outputs (architecture designs, performance metrics, scalability metrics, maintainability scores, interactive visualizations), any specific constraints or considerations (security standards, platform compatibility, performance benchmarks, usability guidelines, accessibility standards), non-functional requirements (response times, memory usage, error handling mechanisms, logging and monitoring), expected interaction between the AI system and human designers (feedback and suggestions for improvement during the design process, mechanism for designers to override or customize AI system's suggestions), handling edge cases, potential errors, and a mechanism for designers to provide feedback. Additionally, the documentation should be organized in a user-friendly format, easily accessible, regularly updated as new requirements arise, and clearly categorized based on the nature of the requirement (e.g., functional, non-functional, technical debt). It should also include any necessary API documentation if applicable, with clear examples and usage scenarios. The documentation will serve as a guide for developers during the implementation phase and should be reviewed by both the project manager and code architect before implementation to ensure they align with the project vision and goals. Once completed, the document will undergo further review from the assigned team member (task-decomposer) for initial comments or suggested edits before moving forward. To streamline the review process, please provide initial comments or suggested edits within this RFC task before it is assigned for final review. The rfc_state field should be updated to 'READY_FOR_TEAM_REVIEW'.",
