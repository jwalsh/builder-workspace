    "description": "Gather and document the comprehensive requirements for the AIArchitect system. The requirements should include input formats (structured data, programming languages), desired outputs (architecture designs, performance metrics, scalability metrics, maintainability scores), any specific constraints or considerations (security standards, platform compatibility, performance benchmarks), non-functional requirements (response times, memory usage, error handling mechanisms), and outline the expected interaction between the AI system and human designers. Additionally, it should specify how to handle edge cases, potential errors, and how to provide feedback and suggestions for improvement during the design process. The documentation should be organized in a user-friendly format, easily accessible, regularly updated as new requirements arise, and clearly categorized based on the nature of the requirement (e.g., functional, non-functional, technical debt). It should also include any necessary API documentation if applicable. Once completed, the document will serve as a guide for developers during the implementation phase. The project manager or task decomposer should review and validate the requirements to ensure they align with the project vision and goals.",

The design has been reviewed and approved by the team. It is recommended to update the RFC document with detailed specifications for each module, interfaces, and expected performance metrics for the next phase: Task Decomposition. Please note that it is crucial to include a clear definition of the expected interactions between different modules, along with potential bottlenecks and solutions to mitigate them.",
