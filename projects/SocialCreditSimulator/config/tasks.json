    "title": "Define Project Scope and Requirements (Revised)",
    "description": "This RFC aims to detail the comprehensive requirements for the SocialCreditSimulator system. The requirements will cover various social credit system models to be simulated, desired outputs and visualizations, target users (policymakers, researchers, general public), data sources, performance and scalability requirements, security considerations, ethical implications, guidelines on data privacy and protection, and any other relevant technical and non-technical requirements. This documentation will serve as a foundation for the project and guide its development. To ensure clarity and completeness, it is crucial to seek feedback from all stakeholders during this process, including experts in related fields such as sociology, economics, and law. It is also important to involve users early in the design process to gather their requirements and preferences. Once finalized, this document will be used to create user stories, technical specifications, and acceptance criteria for each feature of the system. To ensure that the RFC is ready for the next state, it would be beneficial to add a timeline for completing each section of the document and an estimated completion date, as well as setting up a feedback mechanism to collect comments and suggestions from stakeholders throughout the development process. It's also important to note that this document should be reviewed by the Project Manager and Task Decomposer before moving forward. To ensure that the RFC is ready for approval, it needs to be approved by the Technical Writer, who will be responsible for finalizing the document in a clear and concise manner. This task has been reassigned to 'task-decomposer' for further breakdown of tasks and collaboration with the Project Manager and other stakeholders.",

Ensure that the architecture is modular, scalable, and maintainable. Given the sensitive nature of the project, prioritize data privacy, security, and ethical considerations in the design process. Strive for an open-source and transparent approach to foster trust among users. Document all architectural decisions, providing explanations for choices made in line with the project's goals and constraints. Include mockups or diagrams to facilitate understanding. Update this RFC as the architecture evolves, ensuring consistency with the project's objectives. Upon completion, review and iterate based on feedback from relevant stakeholders before moving to implementation.",
