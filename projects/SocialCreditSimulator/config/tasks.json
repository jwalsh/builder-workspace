This documentation will serve as a foundation for the project and guide its development. Also, it is essential to address the ethical implications of such a system and include guidelines on data privacy and protection.",

Consider the need for data privacy, security, and ethical considerations given the sensitive nature of the project, with a focus on creating an open-source and transparent design that fosters trust among users. Clearly document all architectural decisions and provide explanations for choices made in light of the project's goals and constraints. Provide mockups or diagrams to facilitate understanding. Update this RFC as the architecture evolves, ensuring that the design remains consistent with the project's objectives.",
