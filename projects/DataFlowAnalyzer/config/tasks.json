    "description": "Gather and document the functional and non-functional requirements for the DataFlowAnalyzer tool, including the types of software systems it should support (web applications, mobile apps, desktop apps, and possibly serverless functions), the data flow analysis techniques to be used (dynamic analysis, static analysis, hybrid approach, considering incremental analysis to improve performance on large projects), the desired visualization and reporting capabilities (interactive visualizations, customizable dashboards, exportable reports in various formats such as CSV, PDF, and JSON, providing options for real-time updates), integration with existing development tools such as IDEs (supporting popular ones like Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, and Eclipse), version control systems (Git, SVN), and continuous integration/continuous deployment tools (Jenkins, Travis CI, CircleCI), and the specific user roles it should cater to (developers, QA engineers, DevOps, possibly data scientists). Also consider any necessary security requirements for handling sensitive data (compliance with GDPR, HIPAA, and other regulations as applicable), scalability concerns for large software systems, the tool's compatibility with various programming languages and frameworks (Java, Python, JavaScript, .NET, Ruby on Rails, Django), and usability considerations (accessibility, localization, performance optimization). The requirements document should also include a section for potential future enhancements. Once the requirements are defined, create user stories and acceptance criteria to guide the development process. After approval of the requirements document, update the rfc_state field to 'APPROVED' and assign the task to the project-manager.",
