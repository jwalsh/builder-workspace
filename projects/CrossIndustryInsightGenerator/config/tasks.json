Specify the technology stack, integration points, and deployment strategy while considering scalability, performance, security, and maintainability requirements. Incorporate feedback from the Project Planning and Requirements Gathering phase. Collaborate with team members for technical feasibility and potential challenges. Provide a clear breakdown of tasks for each role involved in the implementation, focusing on modularity, testability, and documentation. Prioritize reusable components to ensure scalability and maintainability, and incorporate best practices for secure coding. Consider using cloud services for infrastructure deployment while ensuring compliance with company policies and regulations. Suggest including a proof-of-concept (PoC) as part of the design process for validation of the proposed architecture. This will help in identifying potential issues early and refining the design accordingly.",
