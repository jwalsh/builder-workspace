    "description": "This RFC presents a revised system architecture design for the GeneticHeritageJourney project. The design encompasses the frontend, backend, database, and infrastructure components, with emphasis on microservices architecture to ensure modularity and ease of maintenance. Scalability, maintainability, performance, security, and user experience are prioritized in this design. The proposed technology stack is detailed, along with integration points, API documentation. Attention has been given to handling genetic data privacy in compliance with relevant laws and regulations. A development roadmap for the different components is provided, along with estimated timelines. A clear handoff plan ensures a smooth transition to the implementation phase.",
