    "description": "Design the overall system architecture for the AnonymousPulseChecker platform, encompassing backend, frontend, and database components. Focus on scalability, security, and performance requirements while considering best practices for microservices architecture. Define the communication protocols and data flow between these components, including APIs and event-driven mechanisms. Identify suitable third-party services or libraries for integration while ensuring proper separation of concerns and modular design for maintainability and extensibility. Address data privacy and anonymity concerns, including pseudonymization, encryption, and secure data storage methods in compliance with relevant regulations such as GDPR and CCPA. Plan for monitoring, logging, error handling mechanisms, and data backup/recovery strategies. Additionally, provide detailed documentation for the design in a technical writing format, ensuring clarity and adherence to style guides. Include mockups or diagrams to aid comprehension when possible. Upon completion, conduct code reviews and iterate as necessary. Collaborate with the team throughout the process, soliciting feedback and addressing concerns promptly. Lastly, ensure that the design is testable, scalable, and secure, and follows best practices for the selected technology stack. Provide a preliminary timeline for the completion of this task, which should be no more than 4 weeks, assuming adequate resources are available. Upon completion, update the rfc_state to 'REVIEWED' and assign the task to the 'task-decomposer'. The revised RFC emphasizes the need to prioritize user privacy and security throughout the design process, ensuring that our platform provides a safe and trustworthy environment for employees. This RFC is now ready for review.",
