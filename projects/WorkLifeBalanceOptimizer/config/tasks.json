    "description": "Design the overall system architecture for WorkLifeBalanceOptimizer. The design should include data models (e.g., User, Task, Workload, Work-Life Balance Score), APIs (RESTful and GraphQL where necessary), infrastructure (considering cloud services like AWS or Google Cloud), security considerations (data encryption, user authentication, authorization, and access control), and a robust database design for handling sensitive user data. Integrate machine learning algorithms (Supervised Learning with regression techniques for pattern analysis in work-life balance data). Outline the system's data flow, interactions between various components, and microservices architecture for scalability and flexibility. Also, consider implementing containerization technologies such as Docker for deployment.",
