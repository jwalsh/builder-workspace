# CyberAttackPredictor Data Processing Pipeline Design

## Overview
This document outlines the design of the data processing pipeline for the CyberAttackPredictor system.

## Pipeline Stages

1. Data Ingestion
   - Collect data from various sources (network logs, threat feeds, dark web data)
   - Validate data format and integrity
   - Store raw data in MongoDB

2. Data Cleaning
   - Remove duplicates and invalid entries
   - Handle missing values
   - Normalize data formats

3. Feature Extraction
   - Extract relevant features from raw data
   - Perform text analysis on unstructured data
   - Generate derived features

4. Data Transformation
   - Scale numerical features
   - Encode categorical variables
   - Perform dimensionality reduction if necessary

5. Data Aggregation
   - Combine data from multiple sources
   - Create time-based aggregations
   - Generate summary statistics

6. Model Input Preparation
   - Format data for specific model requirements
   - Split data into training and testing sets
   - Perform any final preprocessing steps

## Technologies
- Apache Kafka for data streaming
- Apache Spark for distributed data processing
- scikit-learn for feature extraction and transformation
- Pandas for data manipulation

## Data Flow
1. Raw data → Kafka topics
2. Kafka → Spark Streaming for real-time processing
3. Spark → MongoDB for storing processed data
4. MongoDB → Model training and prediction services

## Scalability Considerations
- Use Kafka partitioning for parallel processing
- Implement Spark dynamic resource allocation
- Design for horizontal scaling of processing nodes

## Monitoring and Error Handling
- Implement data quality checks at each stage
- Use Apache Airflow for pipeline orchestration and monitoring
- Implement retry mechanisms for transient failures
- Log all processing errors for analysis

## Data Versioning
- Implement a data versioning system to track changes in processed datasets
- Store version metadata alongside processed data
