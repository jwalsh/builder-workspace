    "description": "This RFC aims to gather and document comprehensive project requirements for the Holographic Ad Network. Key areas of focus include: \n1. Types of holographic advertisements (static, interactive, immersive) \n2. Target public spaces (malls, stadiums, airports) \n3. Desired user interactions (gesture recognition, voice commands, QR code scanning, eye-tracking) \n4. Analytics/tracking needs (impression tracking, click-through rates, dwell time, geolocation data for targeted ads, heatmaps, conversion rates) \n5. Additional features such as customization options for advertisers, privacy controls, accessibility considerations, and user feedback mechanisms. Technical specifications for holographic projection systems (hardware requirements, software support), network infrastructure requirements (bandwidth, latency, redundancy), potential integration with existing advertising platforms, and scalability considerations are also addressed. Additionally, security concerns (data protection, privacy regulations) will be tackled, along with the exploration of machine learning applications to enhance ad targeting and user experience. The RFC is currently in REVIEW_IN_PROGRESS state.",
