    "description": "Design the data model for representing the knowledge graph, including entities, relationships, and associated metadata. The data model should support efficient storage, retrieval, and querying of the knowledge graph data, considering factors such as scalability, performance, and data integrity. This includes selecting a suitable database technology that can handle complex data structures and provide good querying capabilities for this purpose. Additionally, specify the schema design and normalization strategy to optimize the storage and retrieval of large amounts of data expected. Consider using a graph database like Neo4j or Amazon Neptune for their ability to efficiently handle complex relationships and queries. Include a brief rationale for the chosen database technology. Also, discuss the potential trade-offs and limitations of this choice. Furthermore, provide an outline of the data modeling process with milestones and expected timeline.",
