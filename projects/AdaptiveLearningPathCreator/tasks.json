    "description": "Gather and document the requirements for the AdaptiveLearningPathCreator system, including user personas, goals, features, constraints, and non-functional requirements such as performance, scalability, security, accessibility, usability, and maintainability. Identify stakeholders and conduct interviews or workshops to gather requirements. Ensure to cover requirements related to the AI-driven personalization engine (including data input/output formats, training data sources, and models), user interface (UI/UX design considerations), data management (data storage, retrieval, and privacy policies), integration with coding platforms or resources, API documentation, test cases, and any other relevant aspects. Provide clear and concise documentation for each requirement, including rationale, dependencies, and acceptance criteria. In addition, it would be beneficial to consider potential future expansions of the system, such as support for multiple programming languages or integration with additional learning resources. Lastly, ensure that the documentation is easily accessible and updated as the project progresses.",
