    "description": "Conduct comprehensive user research and stakeholder interviews to thoroughly understand the problem space, user needs, and desired features for the PersonalizedAdMemorySupressor system. Investigate ethical, legal, and privacy considerations, potential unintended consequences, and existing solutions in this field. The gathered data will be compiled into a detailed report, considering both qualitative and quantitative findings. This report will then be presented to the team for discussion, along with recommendations for feature implementation. Additionally, explore potential integration points with existing platforms (e.g., social media, browsers) that could facilitate the functionality of the PersonalizedAdMemorySupressor system.",

This design should also include a plan for evaluating the system's effectiveness in reducing the psychological impact of advertisements on users' purchasing decisions. Finally, provide an estimate of timelines and resources required for each component's development.",
