    "description": "Conduct comprehensive user research and stakeholder interviews to thoroughly understand the problem space, user needs, desired features, ethical, legal, privacy considerations, potential unintended consequences, and existing solutions in this field. The gathered data will be compiled into a detailed report, considering both qualitative and quantitative findings. This report will then be presented to the team for discussion, along with recommendations for feature implementation. Additionally, explore potential integration points with existing platforms (e.g., social media, browsers) that could facilitate the functionality of the PersonalizedAdMemorySupressor system, and evaluate their technical feasibility and impact on user experience. The task will also include a review of relevant literature in the field of memory suppression, psychology, and advertising. This updated description aims to provide a clearer scope for the task. Once completed, this task will be ready for task decomposition. It is recommended to involve the project manager to ensure alignment with project goals and timelines. The 'assigned_to' field should be updated to 'project-manager'.",

Ensure compatibility with existing privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA), prepare for future updates, account for potential ethical implications of memory suppression, and design a system evaluation plan to measure its effectiveness in reducing the psychological impact of advertisements on users' purchasing decisions. Additionally, provide an estimate of timelines and resources required for each component's development, suggestions for improved organization and clarity, and address potential risks associated with the system's functionality and user data protection (including a detailed risk assessment). This update also includes guidelines for handling sensitive information, addressing any ethical concerns, potential biases in memory suppression, and recommendations for handling such cases. Finally, provide a clear roadmap for each component's development with milestones and deadlines. This task is assigned to the code-architect.",

Consider setting up a test environment that replicates real-world user conditions, and ensure this environment includes edge cases for thorough testing.\n\n**Recommendations:** For automation tools, consider using Selenium WebDriver for frontend testing and PyTest for backend testing. Also, include stress testing to simulate high loads during peak usage periods.\n\n**Assigned To:** code-architect",
