The revised design should be intuitive, visually appealing, accessible to all users, mobile-responsive as a significant number of our users are expected to access the system through mobile devices.\n\nTo ensure consistency with our Design System Architecture, please integrate the design with existing UI patterns and components. Additionally, ensure that the revised design is compliant with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA for accessibility and responsive to different screen sizes.\n\nFor better separation of concerns, I suggest breaking down the task into smaller parts: Design Input Form, Search Results Layout, Carbon Footprint Display, and Eco-friendly Travel Options UI.\n\nFurthermore, consider adding a feature for users to customize their preferences, such as preferred travel mode, budget, and desired eco-friendly features. Also, consider incorporating a feedback system to improve the quality of recommendations.",
