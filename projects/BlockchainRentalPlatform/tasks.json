Deploy to a staging environment for testing with automatic rollback capability in case of issues.\n5. Deploy to production after successful testing, with option for manual deployment for additional safety.\n6. Implement monitoring and alerting mechanisms to notify the team of any failures or issues.\n7. Ensure pipeline supports multiple environments (e.g., development, staging, production) and adheres to established naming conventions for environment configurations.\n8. Improve error handling by logging and reporting detailed information about failed tests, builds, and deployments.\n\nThe assigned DevOps Engineer should consider the following best practices:\n- Modularize the pipeline to allow for easy maintenance and updates.\n- Optimize the pipeline for performance and scalability to handle increasing traffic and code changes.\n- Document the pipeline setup and configuration for future reference.",
