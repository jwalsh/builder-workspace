This includes but is not limited to user stories, use cases, technical constraints, regulatory compliance considerations (e.g., data privacy, fair housing laws), integration with blockchain technology and smart contracts, scalability and performance requirements, potential security risks and mitigation strategies, a detailed functional specification document focusing on the automation of payments, deposits, and conflict resolution between landlords and tenants, user-interface design considerations, and a plan for testing and iterating based on user feedback. The aim is to ensure the platform's automation of payments, deposits, and conflict resolution between landlords and tenants is robust, secure, user-friendly, and meets the needs of our users. Update the rfc_state field to 'REVIEW_COMPLETED' when the revised description and any additional suggestions are implemented.",

Consider scalability, security, fault tolerance, performance requirements, and edge cases such as error handling and performance optimizations. Define data models, APIs, communication protocols, and interaction flows between different components. Address potential challenges such as data privacy, regulatory compliance, dispute resolution mechanisms, and consider long-term maintenance and extensibility. Provide a detailed design document with clear specifications for each component, including a section on how the system will handle cross-chain interactions (if applicable), and a comparison of the chosen technologies against potential alternatives. Provide justifications for all decisions made during the design process. Update the document regularly to reflect changes or additions as the project progresses.",

Additionally, explore opportunities to leverage AI/ML for personalized user experiences, while considering potential security implications. Collaborate closely with the code-architect to ensure compatibility with smart contract architecture and data models. Update task dependencies to reflect the current progress. For the UI/UX design phase, break down the tasks into smaller, manageable units (e.g., wireframing, prototyping, usability testing) for efficient implementation and tracking.
