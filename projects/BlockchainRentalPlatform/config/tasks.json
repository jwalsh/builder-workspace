This includes but is not limited to user stories, use cases, technical constraints, regulatory compliance considerations (e.g., data privacy, fair housing laws), integration with blockchain technology and smart contracts, scalability and performance requirements, potential security risks and mitigation strategies, a detailed functional specification document focusing on the automation of payments, deposits, and conflict resolution between landlords and tenants, user-interface design considerations, testing strategy including plans for iterating based on user feedback, and a plan for documentation. The aim is to ensure the platform's automation of payments, deposits, and conflict resolution between landlords and tenants is robust, secure, user-friendly, and meets the needs of our users. Update the rfc_state field to 'REVIEW_COMPLETED' when the revised description and any additional suggestions are implemented. Additionally, consider researching existing solutions in the market for comparison and best practices integration.",

Consider scalability, security, fault tolerance, performance requirements, and edge cases such as error handling and performance optimizations. Define data models, APIs, communication protocols, and interaction flows between different components. Address potential challenges such as data privacy, regulatory compliance, dispute resolution mechanisms, and consider long-term maintenance and extensibility. Provide a detailed design document with clear specifications for each component, including a section on how the system will handle cross-chain interactions (if applicable), and a comparison of the chosen technologies against potential alternatives. Justify all decisions made during the design process, providing reasons for choosing certain technologies over others. Update the document regularly to reflect changes or additions as the project progresses. Additionally, consider the security implications of the design decisions, especially with regards to smart contracts and blockchain infrastructure.",

Consider data privacy, security, and scalability requirements. Ensure the schema supports efficient querying and data retrieval for various use cases. The data models should also account for potential future extensions, such as integrating with third-party services or supporting additional features. Additionally, design the schema to support data partitioning and sharding strategies for improved scalability and performance, taking into account any potential performance bottlenecks that may arise from blockchain integration. Furthermore, consider using a database system capable of handling high concurrency and transaction volumes, such as GraphQL or Apache Cassandra, while also being flexible enough to support future changes in technology. Research and recommend appropriate encryption methods to protect sensitive data, with a focus on efficient performance and compatibility with the chosen database system. Lastly, provide a clear documentation of the data models, schema, and encryption choices, making it easily accessible for all team members and future developers. The task will be split into several sub-tasks: (1) Define basic data models and schema, (2) Implement data partitioning and sharding strategies, (3) Integrate with the chosen database system, (4) Optimize for performance and scalability, and (5) Document the data models, schema, and encryption choices.
