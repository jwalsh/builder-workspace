    "description": "Conduct a comprehensive literature review on time crystals and their potential applications in quantum computing architectures. Identify key concepts, challenges, existing approaches, and potential novel applications or architectures that leverage time crystals for quantum information processing. This task requires the expertise of a code-architect due to the complex nature of quantum computing. The focus should be on understanding the theoretical aspects as well as possible practical implementations. The review should also consider the implications of using time crystals in the context of our current project, TimeCrystalComputer.",

The design will consider scalability, fault tolerance, error correction mechanisms, control systems, potential applications, and the role of time crystals in the proposed system. A high-level overview of the architecture will be provided, including key components, their interactions, and the role of time crystals, as well as an analysis of the potential benefits and challenges of using time crystals for quantum computing. This document is intended to serve as a foundation for further research and development, inviting collaboration and discussion among team members. The RFC will be updated throughout the process to reflect the evolving design.",
