    "description": "Gather, document, and prioritize detailed requirements for the DataSyncIntegrityVerifier system. These requirements should include the platforms (e.g., Linux, Windows, Mobile), databases (specific versions if known) such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB etc., synchronization scenarios (real-time, periodic, event-driven), expected behavior (success, failure handling, retries), performance criteria (throughput, latency, error tolerance), security considerations (data privacy, encryption algorithms like AES, authentication methods like OAuth2, JWT), compliance requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.), integration with existing systems or third-party services (APIs or interfaces), and any necessary APIs or interfaces. Identify any potential challenges, constraints, or trade-offs that may impact the project's scope or delivery timeline, such as system compatibility issues, network latencies, or data volume limitations. Also, consider the scalability, reliability, fault tolerance, and maintainability of the solution. Provide examples for each requirement where applicable to facilitate understanding. Additionally, ensure the documentation is clear, concise, and accessible to all team members. Include any user stories or use cases that illustrate how the system will be used in real-world scenarios.",
