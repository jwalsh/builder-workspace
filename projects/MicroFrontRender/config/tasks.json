The design should also address the choice between streaming-based SSR vs traditional SSR, discuss the trade-offs of each approach, suggest potential solutions for offline support, progressive web apps (PWA) implementation, cross-browser compatibility, and consider mobile application integration. In addition, please outline the testing strategy to ensure cross-platform compatibility and performance under varying network conditions. Lastly, provide recommendations on how to handle upgrades or updates to the chosen technologies during the project lifecycle. The RFC is ready for the next state: IMPLEMENTATION.",
