Consider the following aspects: 1) Serverless infrastructure (e.g., AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Google Cloud Functions) for hosting micro-frontends and server-side rendering. 2) Micro-frontend composition strategy (e.g., build-time integration, run-time integration) and communication between micro-frontends. 3) Server-side rendering approach (e.g., Node.js, .NET Core, Go) and data fetching strategies. 4) Caching and performance optimization techniques. 5) Deployment and CI/CD pipelines. 6) Monitoring, logging, and error handling mechanisms. 7) Security considerations (e.g., CSRF, XSS, CORS).",
