    "title": "System Architecture Design",
    "description": "Design the overall system architecture, including components, data flow, integration points, and considerations for scalability, fault tolerance, maintainability, modularity, edge cases, error handling, and performance optimization. The architecture should include the following components: 1) Data Ingestion Layer: Responsible for collecting and preprocessing log data from various sources, handling different log formats, ensuring data integrity, and providing a mechanism to handle large volumes of data efficiently. Consider using a stream-processing system like Apache Kafka or Apache Flink for real-time data processing. 2) Data Storage Layer: A distributed, scalable, and fault-tolerant storage solution like Apache Hadoop or Cassandra for storing and managing large volumes of log data. Ensure the data storage layer is compatible with the chosen stream-processing system. 3) Data Processing Layer: Utilize AI/ML models (e.g., anomaly detection, pattern recognition, natural language processing) to analyze and extract insights from log data. Consider using frameworks like Apache Spark or TensorFlow. Also, investigate the use of pre-trained models for faster deployment. 4) User Interface: A modern, responsive, and user-friendly web-based interface for system administrators to view and interact with the analysis results, insights, and visualizations. Ensure the UI is mobile-friendly and accessible. 5) Monitoring and Alerting: Mechanisms to monitor system health, performance, and potential issues, and send alerts for critical issues via email, SMS, or integration with monitoring tools like Prometheus or Grafana. Implement monitoring at both the application and infrastructure level. 6) Security and Access Control: Implement robust security measures, including authentication, authorization, and data encryption, to protect sensitive log data and ensure compliance with relevant regulations. Perform regular security audits and vulnerability assessments. 7) API Layer: Expose a RESTful API for integrating with other systems or third-party tools. Ensure the API is well-documented and adheres to RESTful principles. 8) Deployment and Orchestration: Consider containerization (e.g., Docker) and orchestration tools (e.g., Kubernetes) for scalable and efficient deployment and management of the system components. Ensure the chosen containerization and orchestration solutions are compatible with all other components.",
