    "title": "Define Comprehensive Project Requirements for NeuroProstheticLimbController - Revised",
    "description": "Create a detailed and comprehensive document outlining the functional and non-functional requirements for the NeuroProstheticLimbController. The document should clearly define user needs, system constraints, performance expectations, security considerations, interface design, and provide detailed sections for each major component of the system (e.g., BCI hardware, software algorithms, prosthetic limb control). The document will serve as a foundation for the project's development. The requirements document should be structured to allow easy understanding and adaptability as the project progresses. Consider adding specific metrics for each requirement where applicable, and provide examples or use cases to aid in understanding. Also, include any relevant standards or regulations that should be followed during the development process, such as ISO 13485:2016 - Medical devices \u2013 Quality management systems \u2013 Requirements for regulatory purposes. To ensure comprehensive coverage, it would be beneficial to consult with subject matter experts (SMEs) in areas such as BCI, prosthetics, and human-computer interaction. The revised requirements document will be submitted to the project manager for approval upon completion.",
