    "description": "Gather and document the requirements for the serverless computing platform, including features, performance, scalability, security, integration with existing systems, and deployment strategies. Define the architecture, technology stack, and development processes. Additionally, consider edge cases, error handling, and monitoring/logging mechanisms. Ensure the documentation is clear, concise, and easily understandable for all stakeholders, emphasizing the importance of thorough error handling and robust monitoring/logging mechanisms. Include a section on potential issues or limitations, and outline strategies to mitigate them. For ease of understanding, use examples and diagrams where appropriate. Ensure the document is easily accessible and version-controlled.",
