    "description": "Conduct a thorough analysis of the project's requirements for the EmotionalAIForCustomerService. This involves identifying the emotional states to detect (e.g., happy, sad, angry, etc.), desired response customization, platform compatibility needs, and any necessary integrations or APIs. Additionally, outline potential data sources (e.g., voice recognition, facial expression analysis), methodology for training and testing the AI model, and consider the ethical implications of emotional AI in customer service. Provide a detailed report summarizing these findings.",
