This includes identifying the emotional states to detect (e.g., happy, sad, angry, etc.), desired response customization, platform compatibility needs, and any necessary integrations or APIs. Detail potential data sources (e.g., voice recognition, facial expression analysis), methodology for training and testing the AI model, consider the ethical implications of emotional AI in customer service, and outline a plan for handling privacy concerns. Provide a detailed report summarizing these findings and any necessary design considerations.",

Additionally, consider adding steps for (6) Post-deployment monitoring and (7) Documentation of the deployment process. After completion, perform the following: (8) Update deployment scripts to reflect any changes in the production environment, (9) Conduct periodic reviews to ensure system performance, (10) Implement any necessary updates or patches as needed, and (11) Collaborate with the technical writer for maintaining and updating documentation. If time allows, consider conducting (12) User acceptance testing (UAT).\n\nNote: Add a new step (13) Prepare and deploy a staging environment to conduct UAT before production deployment.\n\nFor better understanding of the process, assign the task to task-decomposer or project-manager.\n\nIf the deployment is successful, update the rfc_state field as 'READY_FOR_APPROVAL'.",
