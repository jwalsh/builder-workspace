    "description": "Thoroughly document the comprehensive requirements for the Autonomous Underwater Surveillance System. Include detailed specifications on areas of interest, surveillance objectives, operational constraints, performance metrics, as well as consideration for integration with existing systems, data storage solutions, and potential future expansions. Additionally, outline the system architecture, detailing software and hardware components, with an emphasis on modularity for ease of future updates. Provide clear use cases and edge-cases, along with non-functional requirements such as security, scalability, maintainability, reliability, and accessibility (for potential human interaction). Also, consider energy efficiency to ensure long operational life underwater.",
