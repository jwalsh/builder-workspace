    "title": "Design system architecture",
    "description": "Design the overall system architecture for the TeamSynergyDashboard project. The design should address the following aspects:\n\n1. Modular design: Divide the system into logical components or modules to promote maintainability, scalability, and reusability.\n2. Data storage: Determine the appropriate database system (relational, NoSQL, or a combination) based on the data structure and query requirements. For data storage, consider using managed solutions like Amazon RDS for relational databases and Amazon DynamoDB for NoSQL databases.\n3. Backend services: Define the necessary backend services for data processing, business logic, and API endpoints. These services could be implemented using serverless architectures like AWS Lambda or traditional server-based solutions. To improve scalability and reduce costs, consider using AWS AppRunner or AWS Fargate in addition to AWS Lambda.\n4. Frontend architecture: Plan the frontend architecture, including UI components, state management, and communication with backend services. Consider using modern frontend frameworks such as React or Angular for building the user interface.\n5. Authentication and authorization: Implement secure authentication and authorization mechanisms for user access and data protection. OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect can be used for handling authentication while role-based access control (RBAC) can be used for authorization.\n6. Integration points: Identify existing systems or services that need to be integrated, such as communication tools, project management tools, or productivity tracking tools. Use well-documented APIs provided by these third-party services and ensure proper error handling and resiliency mechanisms.\n7. Scalability and performance: Consider strategies for horizontal scaling, load balancing, and caching to ensure system performance under high load. Auto-scaling groups on AWS EC2 and Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) can be used for achieving scalability and improved performance. Additionally, implement containerization with Docker and deploy the application using a managed Kubernetes service like Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) to ensure efficient resource utilization.\n8. Monitoring and logging: Incorporate monitoring and logging mechanisms for system health, performance, and debugging using tools like Amazon CloudWatch or ELK Stack. Implement log aggregation and analysis solutions like Logz.io or Splunk for enhanced troubleshooting capabilities.\n9. Deployment and infrastructure: Outline the deployment strategy (e.g., containerization, cloud, on-premises) and infrastructure requirements. Containerize the application using Docker and deploy it to a managed Kubernetes service like Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). For version control, use GitHub or Bitbucket with branching strategies like GitFlow.\n10. Security considerations: Address potential security vulnerabilities by implementing secure coding practices, following OWASP guidelines, performing regular security audits, and addressing any identified issues promptly.",
