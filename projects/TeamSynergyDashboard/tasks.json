Modular design: Divide the system into logical components or modules to promote maintainability, scalability, and reusability.\n2. Data storage: Determine the appropriate database system (relational, NoSQL, or a combination) based on the data structure and query requirements.\n3. Backend services: Define the necessary backend services for data processing, business logic, and API endpoints.\n4. Frontend components: Plan the frontend architecture, including UI components, state management, and communication with backend services.\n5. Authentication and authorization: Implement secure authentication and authorization mechanisms for user access and data protection.\n6. Integration points: Identify existing systems or services that need to be integrated, such as communication tools, project management tools, or productivity tracking tools.\n7. Scalability and performance: Consider strategies for horizontal scaling, load balancing, and caching to ensure system performance under high load.\n8. Monitoring and logging: Incorporate monitoring and logging mechanisms for system health, performance, and debugging.\n9. Deployment and infrastructure: Outline the deployment strategy (e.g., containerization, cloud, on-premises) and infrastructure requirements.",
