The strategy should consider the following aspects:\n\n1. Data storage requirements: Estimate the volume and velocity of data to be handled, and determine the appropriate database technology (e.g., relational, NoSQL, time-series) based on the data characteristics.\n\n2. Data modeling: Design the data models and schemas to represent the complex relationships and hierarchies present in electricity distribution networks, ensuring data integrity and efficient querying.\n\n3. Data integration: Define the mechanisms for integrating data from various sources, such as smart meters, sensors, and external systems, ensuring data consistency and reliability.\n\n4. Data security and privacy: Implement measures to protect sensitive data, such as customer information and network configurations, adhering to industry regulations and best practices.\n\n5. Data archiving and retention: Establish policies and procedures for data archiving, backup, and retention, considering legal and operational requirements.\n\n6. Data access and querying: Develop strategies for efficient data retrieval, analysis, and reporting, considering the diverse needs of stakeholders (e.g., network operators, maintenance teams, billing systems).",
