Data storage requirements: Estimate the volume and velocity of data to be handled, and determine the appropriate database technology (e.g., relational, NoSQL, time-series) based on the data characteristics. Consider using distributed databases to handle large scale data and ensure high availability.\n\n2. Data modeling: Design the data models and schemas to represent the complex relationships and hierarchies present in electricity distribution networks, ensuring data integrity and efficient querying. Use entity relationship diagrams (ERD) for visual representation and documentation.\n\n3. Data integration: Define the mechanisms for integrating data from various sources, such as smart meters, sensors, and external systems, ensuring data consistency and reliability. Implement APIs and middleware services to facilitate seamless data flow and transformation.\n\n4. Data security and privacy: Implement measures to protect sensitive data, such as customer information and network configurations, adhering to industry regulations and best practices. Utilize encryption techniques and access controls to ensure data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.\n\n5. Data archiving and retention: Establish policies and procedures for data archiving, backup, and retention, considering legal and operational requirements. Implement data compression strategies to minimize storage costs.\n\n6. Data access and querying: Develop strategies for efficient data retrieval, analysis, and reporting, considering the diverse needs of stakeholders (e.g., network operators, maintenance teams, billing systems). Implement SQL-based data queries and Business Intelligence tools for ad-hoc analytics and report generation.\n\nThis RFC is ready for the next state, update the rfc_state field to 'IN_PROGRESS'.",
