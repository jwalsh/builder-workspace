Conduct stakeholder interviews, workshops, user story mapping, and create clear, concise, and comprehensive documentation to capture these requirements. Include specific technical components such as data models, APIs, microservices, and interfaces in the project's design. Additionally, consider the following points for improvement: 1. Prioritize requirements based on their impact on system performance and user experience. 2. Identify key performance indicators (KPIs) to monitor and improve the system's efficiency. 3. Consider edge cases and exceptional scenarios during requirement gathering. 4. Collaborate with relevant team members for input and feedback on technical components and design.",

    "description": "Define the data management strategy, including database design, data modeling, and data integration approaches for handling complex electricity distribution network data.\n\n1. Data storage requirements: Estimate the volume and velocity of data to be handled, and determine the appropriate database technology (e.g., relational, NoSQL, time-series) based on the data characteristics. Consider using distributed databases to handle large scale data and ensure high availability.\n\n2. Data modeling: Design the data models and schemas to represent the complex relationships and hierarchies present in electricity distribution networks, ensuring data integrity and efficient querying. Use entity relationship diagrams (ERD) for visual representation and documentation.\n\n3. Data integration: Define the mechanisms for integrating data from various sources, such as smart meters, sensors, and external systems, ensuring data consistency and reliability. Implement APIs and middleware services to facilitate seamless data flow and transformation.\n\n4. Data security and privacy: Implement measures to protect sensitive data, such as customer information and network configurations, adhering to industry regulations and best practices. Utilize encryption techniques and access controls to ensure data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.\n\n5. Data archiving and retention: Establish policies and procedures for data archiving, backup, and retention, considering legal and operational requirements. Implement data compression strategies to minimize storage costs.\n\n6. Data access and querying: Develop strategies for efficient data retrieval, analysis, and reporting, considering the diverse needs of stakeholders (e.g., network operators, maintenance teams, billing systems). Implement SQL-based data queries and Business Intelligence tools for ad-hoc analytics and report generation.\n\nThis RFC is ready for further development after review.

This includes implementing secure authentication and authorization mechanisms (OAuth2 or similar), encrypting sensitive data at rest and in transit using AES-256 encryption, implementing role-based access controls (RBAC) based on job functions, integrating single sign-on (SSO) for seamless user experience, implementing security monitoring and logging mechanisms (SIEM solutions like Splunk or Elasticsearch), performing regular security audits to maintain system security, and ensuring compliance with industry standards such as GDPR, HIPAA, and ISO27001. Additionally, consider the use of Zero Trust Network Architecture principles for added security. The task will also include a thorough review and implementation of the mentioned features in the existing frontend and backend components, as well as the database design. To ensure consistent and efficient workflow, it is recommended to break this task down into smaller subtasks, each with specific deliverables and deadlines. This approach will facilitate better tracking and management of the task progress. Once the subtasks are decomposed, assign them to appropriate team members (frontend-developer, backend-developer, database-specialist, devops-engineer) based on their expertise and availability. The project manager can then oversee the overall progress of the task and ensure timely completion. After the implementation, perform thorough testing and documentation (technical writer) to verify that the implemented features are functioning correctly and comply with the required standards. Update the task description to explicitly state that the tasks will be documented in a way that is understandable by non-technical stakeholders as well. Also, consider adding a task for a penetration test to ensure the system's security against potential attacks. Lastly, update the rfc_state field to 'IN_REVIEW'.",
