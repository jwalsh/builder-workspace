Collaborate with other team members to ensure alignment with project goals. The design will be shared with the Project Manager for review and approval upon completion. This task is divided into sub-tasks: AI model design, system integration design, UI/UX design, data pipeline design, monitoring and logging design, security design, infrastructure design, documentation creation. Each sub-task will be documented separately and cross-referenced within the overall design document. The RFC is ready for review, please update the 'rfc_state' field accordingly.",

    "description": "Design and implement the database schema for storing energy storage system data, AI model parameters, optimization results, and related metadata. The schema should support efficient data retrieval, updates, and querying for the AI optimization algorithms and reporting/visualization components. Consider using a time-series database such as TimescaleDB or InfluxDB for handling large volumes of time-series data, or a hybrid approach combining PostgreSQL with a specialized time-series data store like TimescaleDB. Implement partitioning and sharding strategies to ensure scalability and high performance. Incorporate data validation, indexing, and caching mechanisms. Ensure data security and access control mechanisms are in place, leveraging technologies like row-level security (RLS) in PostgreSQL or role-based access control (RBAC) in TimescaleDB. Implement data backup and disaster recovery strategies. In the event of a conflict between AI optimization algorithms and reporting/visualization components, prioritize the former. Establish communication channels with these teams to coordinate and ensure smooth operation. Upon completion, perform a comprehensive performance benchmarking and optimize as necessary. Once approved, pass on the task to the 'database-specialist' for implementation. It would be beneficial to also include integration tests with the AI optimization algorithms and reporting/visualization components during the development process to ensure seamless operation. Additionally, consider using tools like pgAdmin or DBeaver for managing and debugging the database schema. Update the 'rfc_state' field to 'APPROVED'. However, I suggest adding more emphasis on ensuring the database design is flexible enough to accommodate potential future expansions of the system, including new types of AI models or energy storage systems. Also, consider incorporating versioning mechanisms for the database schema and data. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to clarify the specific communication channels to be established (Slack/email/Meetings etc.) and the key performance indicators (KPIs) to monitor during operation. Lastly, please ensure that the 'assigned_to' field is set to 'database-specialist'.",
