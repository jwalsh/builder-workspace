    "description": "Design and implement the database schema for storing energy storage system data, AI model parameters, optimization results, and related metadata. The schema should support efficient data retrieval, updates, and querying for the AI optimization algorithms and reporting/visualization components. Consider using a time-series database such as TimescaleDB or InfluxDB for handling large volumes of time-series data, or a hybrid approach combining PostgreSQL with a specialized time-series data store like TimescaleDB. Implement partitioning and sharding strategies to ensure scalability and high performance. Incorporate data validation, indexing, and caching mechanisms. Ensure data security and access control mechanisms are in place, leveraging technologies like row-level security (RLS) in PostgreSQL or role-based access control (RBAC) in TimescaleDB. Implement data backup and disaster recovery strategies. In the event of a conflict between AI optimization algorithms and reporting/visualization components, prioritize the former. Establish communication channels with these teams to coordinate and ensure smooth operation. Upon completion, perform a comprehensive performance benchmarking and optimize as necessary. Once approved, pass on the task to the 'database-specialist' for implementation. It would be beneficial to also include integration tests with the AI optimization algorithms and reporting/visualization components during the development process to ensure seamless operation. Additionally, consider using tools like pgAdmin or DBeaver for managing and debugging the database schema. Update the 'rfc_state' field to 'APPROVED_FOR_REFINED_IMPLEMENTATION' as there are some additional points that need further discussion before implementation.",
