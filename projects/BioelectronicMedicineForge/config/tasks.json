    "description": "Update the project scope, objectives, and requirements for the bioelectronic medical device platform. Involve relevant stakeholders, including medical professionals, regulatory bodies, end-users, and subject matter experts in bioelectronics and neural interfaces. Prioritize consideration of factors like safety, security, usability, scalability, regulatory compliance, data privacy, and ethical considerations. After gathering feedback from the approved RFC, evaluate and update the project requirements based on criticality and risk assessment. Upon completion, submit the revised requirements to the Project Manager for review and final approval. If necessary, collaborate with the assigned developer teams (frontend/backend) and specialists (database, devops, security, technical writing) throughout this process. If required, consult with the assigned QA tester to ensure testability of the updated requirements.",
