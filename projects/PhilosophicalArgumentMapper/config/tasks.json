The interface should be intuitive, responsive, accessible, adaptable to different types of philosophical arguments, and adhering to best practices in user experience (UX) design. This task includes wireframing, prototyping, usability testing, and iterative improvements based on feedback. To ensure consistency with our project's Design System Architecture, the interface should align closely with its guidelines. However, it would be beneficial to explicitly state that the interface should adhere to the Design System Architecture in the task description. This task is assigned to a frontend-developer who has experience in UX/UI design and a strong understanding of our Design System Architecture for optimal results. The task remains 'IN_PROGRESS', but I recommend scheduling regular check-ins with the assigned frontend-developer to monitor progress, address any challenges that may arise, and provide feedback during the development process.",
