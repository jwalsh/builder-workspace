Include clear documentation with examples and consider potential future improvements such as multi-language support, interactive features, integration with external APIs, real-time collaboration, and improved accessibility. Upon completion, conduct code reviews, refactor as necessary, and decompose tasks for implementation. Update the design to accommodate real-time collaboration and improve accessibility. Upon approval, prepare for task decomposition. Clarify that this RFC is for the system architecture design, not the frontend or backend implementation.",

    "description": "Create a user-friendly interface for inputting philosophical arguments, visualizing the argument structure, and interacting with the tool. The interface should be intuitive, responsive, accessible, adaptable to different types of philosophical arguments, and adhering to best practices in user experience (UX) design. This task includes wireframing, prototyping, usability testing, and iterative improvements based on feedback. To ensure consistency with our project's Design System Architecture, the interface should align closely with its guidelines. It is important to explicitly state that the interface should adhere to the Design System Architecture in the task description. This task is assigned to a frontend-developer who has experience in UX/UI design and a strong understanding of our Design System Architecture for optimal results. To facilitate efficient progress, regular check-ins with the assigned frontend-developer are recommended to monitor progress, address any challenges that may arise, and provide feedback during the development process. The task remains 'IN_PROGRESS', but it would be beneficial to set an estimated completion date based on the current progress for better project planning. Upon completion of this task, a comprehensive review by the code-architect is necessary before moving forward. If any modifications or clarifications are required during the review process, they should be documented in the 'review_comments' field.",
