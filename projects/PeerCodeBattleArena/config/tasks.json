The design will include wireframes, mockups, prototypes, and user flow diagrams that consider accessibility, responsiveness, and intuitive navigation. Potential users' feedback will be gathered and the designs will be iterated upon accordingly. It is recommended to focus on a mobile-first approach for better usability, and to prioritize simplicity and ease of use while maintaining a competitive, engaging atmosphere. The design should also account for live spectating and commentary features, and ensure seamless integration with the overall functionality of the platform. Upon completion, the designs will be handed over to the frontend-developer for implementation.",

Additionally, consider data persistence, scalability for future expansions of the platform, and high availability, as the platform will have real-time requirements. Provide a design that can handle large volumes of traffic and ensure fast response times. Define data types, constraints, and relationships between entities, and provide an ER diagram to visualize the schema.",
