    "description": "This RFC proposes the design of the user interface and experience for the PeerCodeBattleArena platform. The design will include wireframes, mockups, prototypes, and user flow diagrams that consider accessibility, responsiveness, usability, and intuitive navigation. Potential users' feedback will be gathered and the designs will be iterated upon accordingly. It is recommended to focus on a mobile-first approach for better usability, and to prioritize simplicity and ease of use while maintaining a competitive, engaging atmosphere. The design should also account for live spectating and commentary features, seamless integration with the overall functionality of the platform, real-time performance indicators for users, and a clear, concise interface for these interactive elements. Upon completion, the designs will be handed over to the frontend-developer for implementation. Additionally, it would be beneficial to include a section for community building features such as discussion boards, team formation, and leaderboards. To ensure the design aligns with our vision, I suggest involving the project manager and code architect in the review process. The design should also prioritize performance optimization, ensuring that the platform can handle high traffic without compromising user experience.",

Consider the following entities: Users, Problems, Submissions, Contests, Leaderboards, Spectators, Comments, and any other necessary entities. Ensure proper normalization, indexing, and performance optimizations. Define data types, constraints, and relationships between entities. Additionally, consider data persistence, scalability for future expansions of the platform, high availability (real-time requirements), large volumes of traffic, fast response times, and data consistency. Provide a design that accounts for eventual consistency in a distributed system. Include sharding strategies if necessary. Define data types, constraints, and relationships between entities, and provide an ER diagram to visualize the schema. Also, consider the use of open-source database solutions like Cassandra or MongoDB due to their scalability and performance benefits. For this RFC, it would be beneficial to include a discussion on how to handle data partitioning and replication strategies within the chosen database system, as well as any potential trade-offs between consistency and availability. Additionally, consider edge cases such as database failures and recovery mechanisms.",
