    "description": "Design the overall system architecture for the BioInformaticsGenomeAnalyzer project. This includes creating components for data ingestion (utilizing Apache Kafka or Amazon S3), processing (Apache Spark and TensorFlow for different stages, with a preference for TensorFlow for machine learning tasks, especially deep learning models). The design should also include data analysis, visualization, and management. Ensure scalability, performance, security, and maintainability aspects are considered. Provide a detailed breakdown of each component, their interactions, and suggest appropriate technologies for each part, considering the use of containerization (Docker) to facilitate deployment and scaling. Also, provide guidelines for testing (using PyTest) and documentation (using Sphinx). It is recommended to consider additional tools like Apache Airflow for scheduling and monitoring data pipelines, GitLab or Jenkins for continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD), and BigQuery or Redshift for data warehousing to enable complex queries and real-time analytics. Additionally, suggest techniques for handling large genomic data efficiently (e.g., data compression, partitioning) and optimizing ML models for better accuracy. Lastly, consider the use of BigQuery or Redshift for data warehousing to enable complex queries and real-time analytics. To ensure the RFC is ready for implementation, provide a detailed timeline and milestones. If necessary, break down the task into smaller subtasks and assign them accordingly. Once this updated task description has been reviewed, update the rfc_state field to 'REVIEWED'.",

Suggested improvements include real-time data visualization, interactive data exploration tools, a clear and intuitive user flow, seamless collaboration through integration of chat or commenting functionalities, implementation of security measures such as data encryption and secure authentication mechanisms, and emphasis on performance optimization for large datasets. The design is ready for peer review once the assigned frontend developer has considered the suggestions.
