This includes creating components for data ingestion (utilizing Apache Kafka or Amazon S3), processing (Apache Spark and TensorFlow for different stages, with a preference for TensorFlow for machine learning tasks), analysis, visualization, and data management. Ensure scalability, performance, security, and maintainability aspects are considered. Provide a detailed breakdown of each component, their interactions, and suggest appropriate technologies for each part, considering the use of containerization (Docker) to facilitate deployment and scaling. Also, provide guidelines for testing (using PyTest) and documentation (using Sphinx). It is recommended to consider additional tools like Apache Airflow for scheduling and monitoring data pipelines, and GitLab or Jenkins for continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD). Furthermore, suggest techniques for handling large genomic data efficiently and optimizing ML models for better accuracy. Lastly, consider the use of BigQuery or Redshift for data warehousing to enable complex queries and real-time analytics. To ensure the RFC is ready for implementation, provide a detailed timeline and milestones. If necessary, break down the task into smaller subtasks and assign them accordingly.
