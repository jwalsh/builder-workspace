This includes creating components for data ingestion (utilizing Kafka or Amazon S3), processing (Apache Spark or TensorFlow), analysis, visualization, and data management. Ensure scalability, performance, security, and maintainability aspects are considered. Provide a detailed breakdown of each component, their interactions, and suggest appropriate technologies for each part. In addition, consider the use of containerization (Docker) to facilitate deployment and scaling. Also, provide guidelines for testing and documentation. For instance, unit tests can be performed using JUnit or PyTest while technical documentation can be generated using Sphinx.",
