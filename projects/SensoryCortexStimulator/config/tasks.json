The revised design includes: 1) Hardware components (e.g., sensors, stimulators, control unit, power supply) with specifications outlined, 2) Software components (e.g., firmware, signal processing, user interface, data management) with detailed functionality, 3) Communication protocols and interfaces, including safety and security considerations, 4) Scalability and extensibility, 5) User experience and ergonomics, with emphasis on usability and accessibility. The design is modular and scalable, allowing for future updates or extensions. Additionally, the design adheres to best practices in software engineering and prioritizes user safety. The task has been broken down into smaller, manageable sub-tasks to facilitate implementation. Detailed documentation and diagrams have been provided wherever possible. To ensure a seamless transition to the next phase, kindly review and provide your feedback.",
