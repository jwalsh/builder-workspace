The design should cover the following aspects: 1) Hardware components (e.g., sensors, stimulators, control unit, power supply) and their specifications, 2) Software components (e.g., firmware, signal processing, user interface, data management), 3) Communication protocols and interfaces, 4) Safety and security considerations, 5) Scalability and extensibility, 6) User experience and ergonomics. The design should be modular and scalable, allowing for future updates or extensions. Furthermore, ensure that the design follows best practices in software engineering and prioritizes user safety. Break down the task into smaller, manageable sub-tasks to facilitate implementation. Provide detailed documentation and diagrams wherever possible.",
