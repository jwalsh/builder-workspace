    "description": "The AIRFCAnalyzer tool should be designed to handle a broad spectrum of RFCs (functional, technical, architectural, etc.). The analysis criteria should include adherence to style guides, organizational standards, best practices, and potential regulatory compliance requirements. Desired outputs could be a summary report, actionable recommendations, annotated RFCs for clarity, and potential integration with existing systems like project management and version control tools. Consideration of scalability and flexibility is crucial, allowing the tool to handle increased workload and adapt to organizational changes. Machine learning techniques should be incorporated to enhance the analysis process. Break down the task into smaller, manageable subtasks before implementation. Document each step in detail for future reference. To ensure clarity, split the description into sections for 'Functional Requirements', 'Non-Functional Requirements', and 'Integration Points'. Once completed, update the rfc_state field to 'READY_FOR_IMPLEMENTATION' and assign the task to 'task-decomposer' for further decomposition.",
