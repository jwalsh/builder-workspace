    "description": "Clearly outline the requirements for the AI Legal Research Assistant. The system should be capable of performing various types of legal research including case law, statutes, regulations, and administrative decisions. It should access legal data from multiple sources such as legal databases, court records, official gazettes, and legislative sites. The expected outputs are relevant citations, summaries, analyses, and interpretations. Essential features include natural language processing, machine learning, user interface, and API integration. Non-functional requirements involve high performance, scalability, security (data encryption, anonymization, and user authentication), compliance with legal data privacy regulations, and accessibility. Consider edge cases, error handling mechanisms, and performance optimizations. The RFC is ready for the 'REVIEW' state.",

Consider incorporating a microservices architecture for scalability, maintainability, and modularity. Ensure proper error handling, logging, and monitoring mechanisms are in place, and implement these features using best practices such as circuit breakers, retry policies, and distributed tracing. Address security concerns related to handling sensitive legal data and compliance with relevant regulations by following OWASP guidelines and adhering to privacy laws like GDPR and CCPA. To ensure high performance, consider caching strategies for frequently accessed data and optimize data transfer between services.",
