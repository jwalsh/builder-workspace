    "description": "Gather and document the comprehensive requirements for the CodeTranslator system. This includes: supported programming languages (Python, Java, JavaScript, C++, Ruby - these are popular and widely-used languages, with additional consideration for emerging languages like Go, Rust, and Kotlin), translation accuracy goals (aim for 95%+ accuracy with a fallback mechanism for edge cases, including less common coding constructs like generics, exceptions, and coroutines), performance targets (processing speed of less than 1 second for small files, memory usage should be optimized to handle large files without crashing the system while maintaining real-time translation for smaller files), input/output formats (support source code as text files, integrate with popular IDEs such as Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, and cloud-based IDEs like Cloud9 and online code editors like CodePen), error handling strategies (gracefully handle errors and provide detailed error messages for developers, including suggestions for correcting the issue), edge cases considerations (handle common coding constructs like recursion, callbacks, closures, asynchronous programming, and other advanced features), security measures (implement data encryption, authentication using OAuth2 and JWT, and authorization through role-based access control, with a focus on compliance with GDPR and HIPAA regulations for sensitive data), scalability plans (design the system to handle millions of translations per day while maintaining high performance levels and minimal latency, with strategies for load balancing, caching, and distributed computing), bulk translation capabilities, real-time translation monitoring, integrated code testing (with options for unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests using popular frameworks like Jest, Mocha, or TestNG), and any additional features or constraints. Also, outline the user interface design for developers interacting with the system, focusing on simplicity, intuitiveness, and speed. Include options for bulk translations, real-time translation monitoring, and integrated code testing.",
