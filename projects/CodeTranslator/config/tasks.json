    "description": "Gather and document the comprehensive requirements for the CodeTranslator system. This includes: supported programming languages (Python, Java, JavaScript, C++, Ruby - these are popular and widely-used languages), translation accuracy goals (aim for 95%+ accuracy with a fallback mechanism for edge cases), performance targets (processing speed of less than 1 second for small files, memory usage should be optimized to handle large files without crashing the system), input/output formats (support source code as text files and integrate with popular IDEs such as Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm), error handling strategies (gracefully handle errors and provide detailed error messages for developers), edge cases considerations (handle common coding constructs like recursion, callbacks, and closures), security measures (implement data encryption, authentication using OAuth2 and JWT, and authorization through role-based access control), scalability plans (design the system to handle millions of translations per day), and any additional features or constraints. Also, outline the user interface design for developers interacting with the system, focusing on simplicity, intuitiveness, and speed. Include options for bulk translations, real-time translation monitoring, and integrated code testing.",
