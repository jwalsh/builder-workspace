    "title": "System Architecture Design for Automated Checkout System",
    "description": "Design the overall system architecture for the Automated Checkout System. The design will encompass components for computer vision, IoT sensors, payment processing, and integration with existing systems. To ensure scalability, fault tolerance, security, performance requirements, and maintainability, consider the following aspects: 1) Microservices-based architecture to improve modularity and extensibility (consider using API gateways like AWS API Gateway for centralized management). 2) Implement a robust and secure communication protocol between components. Use MQTT for IoT sensors, RESTful APIs for integration with existing systems, and WebSockets for real-time communication when necessary. For the payment processing component, consider using OAuth2.0 for secure authentication and authorization of users. 3) Adopt containerization technologies like Docker or Kubernetes for deployments and scalability. 4) Leverage edge computing to reduce latency and improve system efficiency (consider using AWS Greengrass or Azure IoT Edge). 5) Integrate machine learning techniques for optimal checkout flow (e.g., object detection, QR code recognition, and anomaly detection). Use cloud-based services like Amazon Rekognition, Google Vision API, or Azure Computer Vision for training these models. For model deployment, consider using AWS SageMaker or Azure Machine Learning Services. 6) Implement a monitoring system for troubleshooting and performance analysis using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or Datadog. Detailed documentation, diagrams, and a component interaction overview will be provided to facilitate implementation and maintenance. Provide clear guidelines on the expected data formats and interfaces for each component to streamline development processes. Additionally, consider implementing logging and error handling mechanisms across all components, with centralized logging using services like AWS CloudWatch or Azure Monitor. 7) Include unit tests and integration tests as part of the development process to ensure code quality and maintainability. The task will be decomposed into subtasks for frontend development, backend development, database design, devops setup, QA testing, and security audits. 8) Upon completion of the task decomposition, assign the subtasks to appropriate team members. Once all subtasks are completed, the implementation_state field should be updated accordingly.",

Consider data normalization, indexing strategies, scalability requirements, data security measures such as encryption for sensitive information (e.g., customer details), and ensure the design is flexible enough to accommodate future system enhancements and expansions. The design should also take into account the need for ACID compliance, transaction isolation levels, and parallelism for improved performance. Moreover, explore the use of serverless databases (such as AWS DynamoDB or Google Firebase) to reduce operational overhead and investigate their suitability for the system's requirements. Conduct a performance comparison between traditional relational databases and NoSQL databases (like Apache Cassandra) to justify the choice of database technology. After conducting the comparison, consider using a hybrid approach with both relational (for structured data) and NoSQL databases (for unstructured IoT sensor data). Integrate the database design with the proposed event-driven architecture and real-time analytics. Additionally, ensure that the database is designed to support event-driven triggers for real-time analytics. Update the design document for further discussion. If there are any dependencies on other tasks or RFCs, please update them accordingly. Update the rfc_state field as 'NEEDS_IMPLEMENTATION' once this review is complete.",
