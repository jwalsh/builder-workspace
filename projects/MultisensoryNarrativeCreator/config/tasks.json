    "description": "Gather and document the project scope, user stories, functional (e.g., seamless integration of visual, auditory, olfactory, gustatory, and tactile elements), and non-functional requirements (e.g., platform accessibility, scalability, security) for the MultisensoryNarrativeCreator platform. Identify key stakeholders (designers, developers, subject matter experts, UX specialists, sensory technology experts, accessibility experts) to involve in the requirements gathering process. Conduct comprehensive research on existing solutions for multi-sensory storytelling and explore innovative ways to implement them, with a focus on accessibility and scalability. Consider potential challenges such as device compatibility, content creation, and storage of sensory data, with emphasis on solutions that cater to various devices and platforms. Also, include in the study the privacy implications of collecting, storing, and using sensory data for the platform's operation.",
