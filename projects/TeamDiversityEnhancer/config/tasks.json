    "description": "Detailed requirements gathering for the TeamDiversityEnhancer tool. This includes specifying metrics and criteria for assessing team diversity (e.g., gender, ethnicity, age, educational background, skills, experience), defining the desired user interface and experience for different user roles (HR managers, project managers, team members), outlining integration requirements with existing HR or project management systems, addressing data privacy and security considerations, identifying any regulatory or legal compliance requirements, considering accessibility needs for users with disabilities, and exploring potential machine learning algorithms to enhance the tool's predictive capabilities. The final output will be a comprehensive document detailing these aspects. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to also consider the cultural diversity aspect and incorporate feedback mechanisms for users to provide suggestions or concerns. This updated task reflects the current understanding of the project scope and requirements.",
