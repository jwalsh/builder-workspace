    "description": "This task aims to comprehensively gather, analyze, and document detailed technical requirements for the Advanced Materials Recycling System. The requirements will include specifying the types of materials to be processed (including their properties and characteristics), desired output formats, any specific constraints or regulations to consider (such as safety, environmental, and industry standards), the expected scale and performance requirements (with realistic benchmarks), a clear definition of project boundaries, potential future integrations with existing systems, scalability plans, explorations of opportunities for system optimization, and data structures and databases needed to support the system, including security measures required to protect sensitive information. Additionally, it will analyze the impact on operations, maintenance requirements, and potential risks, outline a plan for testing and validation, and provide recommendations for future research and development. Upon completion, this task will serve as the foundation for the design and development phases. To ensure a thorough review, please provide any suggestions or improvements to refine the scope and the approach for this task.",
