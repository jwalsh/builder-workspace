    "description": "This task involves gathering and documenting detailed requirements for the Advanced Materials Recycling System. The requirements will include specifying the types of materials to be processed, desired output formats, any specific constraints or regulations to consider (including safety and environmental standards), the expected scale and performance requirements, a clear definition of project boundaries, potential future integrations with existing systems, scalability plans, and exploration of opportunities for system optimization. The documentation should also outline the data structures and databases needed to support the system, as well as security measures required to protect sensitive information. Upon completion, this task will serve as the foundation for the design and development phases.",
