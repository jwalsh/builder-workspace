This includes outlining the specific needs of the system, considering ethical and privacy concerns related to neuromarketing and consumer data, addressing potential technical challenges associated with brain-computer interfaces, and specifying the minimum viable product (MVP) to be developed initially. The document should also detail the architecture design, performance requirements, security measures, and user interface/experience aspects of the system.",
