Implement proper data access controls and encryption for sensitive information, ensuring adherence to industry standards for data privacy and protection. Incorporate a layered caching strategy with intelligent cache eviction policies to optimize performance and reduce latency. Collaborate closely with the assigned team members and other stakeholders throughout the process.",
