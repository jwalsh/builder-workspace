Define the technology stack, development tools, and consider performance optimization strategies for interactive coding exercises. Provide a detailed plan for each component, with emphasis on modularity, scalability, and maintainability. Outline potential integration challenges, and propose solutions to ensure seamless functionality. Suggest unit testing strategies for each component to ensure quality and reliability. Also, discuss how the system will handle large datasets, provide a roadmap for future improvements such as real-time data analysis, and address considerations for accessibility and security. If possible, suggest potential collaboration with open-source quantum computing projects for improved functionality. Update the architecture design documents periodically to reflect changes in the development process. Suggest milestones for each phase of the project and provide a timeline for their completion. In the implementation state field, set the state as 'IN_PROGRESS' when work begins.",
