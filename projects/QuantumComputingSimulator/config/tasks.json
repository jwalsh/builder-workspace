The solution should leverage appropriate combinations of relational databases (such as PostgreSQL or MySQL), NoSQL databases (like MongoDB or Cassandra), caching mechanisms (e.g., Redis), and file storage systems (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage) to address data integrity, security, and efficient retrieval. Implement proper data access controls and encryption for sensitive information, ensuring adherence to industry standards for data privacy and protection. Incorporate a layered caching strategy with intelligent cache eviction policies to optimize performance and reduce latency. Collaborate closely with the assigned team members and other stakeholders throughout the process. To ensure thoroughness, consider conducting benchmark tests on different database configurations before making final decisions. For better readability, structure the RFC into sections covering design choices, implementation details, security measures, caching strategies, performance metrics, and a timeline for completion. Once complete, include a section for post-implementation testing and maintenance.",
