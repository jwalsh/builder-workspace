    "description": "Design the overall system architecture, including the AI model, user interface, data storage components, and integration with third-party services (if applicable). Consider the following aspects:\n\n1. AI Model Architecture: Determine the appropriate type of AI model (e.g., transformer-based, RNN, etc.) and the specific architecture (e.g., GPT, BERT, etc.) for the narrative therapy task. Consider the model's ability to understand and generate natural language, as well as its capacity for emotional intelligence and context understanding.\n\n2. User Interface: Design the user interface for both the client-side (e.g., web or mobile app) and the therapist/admin interface. Consider the user experience, accessibility, and intuitive navigation.\n\n3. Data Storage: Determine the data storage requirements, including user data, session transcripts, and any other relevant data. Consider data privacy, security, and compliance with relevant regulations (e.g., HIPAA).\n\n4. Integration: Identify any potential third-party services or APIs that may need to be integrated, such as natural language processing services, sentiment analysis tools, or knowledge bases.\n\n5. Scalability and Performance: Ensure that the architecture can handle increasing user loads and data volumes while maintaining acceptable performance levels.\n\n6. Security and Privacy: Implement appropriate security measures to protect user data and ensure compliance with relevant regulations and industry standards.\n\n7. Monitoring and Logging: Incorporate monitoring and logging mechanisms to track system performance, identify issues, and facilitate debugging and maintenance.",
