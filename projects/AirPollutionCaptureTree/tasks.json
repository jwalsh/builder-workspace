    "description": "This RFC aims to define the project scope, goals, and requirements for the AirPollutionCaptureTree system. The focus will be on a detailed analysis of the problem space (urban air pollution), stakeholder needs (environmental agencies, urban dwellers), technical constraints (material selection, energy efficiency), relevant regulations or standards (e.g., emission standards, safety regulations), and any potential environmental impact studies. Key components and subsystems will be identified, such as the pollutant capture mechanism (adsorption, absorption, or chemical reactions), structural design (material, shape, size), energy management (renewable energy sources, energy storage), monitoring/control systems (sensors, data analysis algorithms), maintenance considerations (durability, replaceable parts), and cost-benefit analyses. Performance metrics, scalability requirements, and potential environmental impact studies will also be outlined. The RFC will provide a comprehensive blueprint for the development of the AirPollutionCaptureTree system. Additionally, the RFC will include a more detailed breakdown of tasks that can be delegated to team members, a timeline for task completion, and a plan for testing and validation. This revised RFC is now ready for implementation.",

    "description": "Revise the description to provide a clearer understanding of the system's architecture. The revised description includes details on the tree structure, air filtration mechanism, integration with urban environments, data management and analysis components, modularity, scalability, energy efficiency, maintainability, and plans for integrating with existing urban infrastructure for optimal effectiveness. The design will consider a hierarchical modular tree structure for efficient pollutant capture, an energy-efficient air filtration system using advanced nanotechnology, data management through a decentralized blockchain network, and real-time analysis and monitoring. The design will also address integration with smart city infrastructure, ensuring seamless operation within urban environments.",
