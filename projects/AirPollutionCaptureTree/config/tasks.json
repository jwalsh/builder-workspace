    "description": "This RFC aims to define the project scope, goals, and requirements for the AirPollutionCaptureTree system. The focus will be on a detailed analysis of the problem space (urban air pollution), stakeholder needs (environmental agencies, urban dwellers), technical constraints (material selection, energy efficiency), relevant regulations or standards (e.g., emission standards, safety regulations), and any potential environmental impact studies. Key components and subsystems will be identified, such as the pollutant capture mechanism (adsorption, absorption, or chemical reactions), structural design (material, shape, size), energy management (renewable energy sources, energy storage), monitoring/control systems (sensors, data analysis algorithms), maintenance considerations (durability, replaceable parts), and cost-benefit analyses. Performance metrics, scalability requirements, and potential environmental impact studies will also be outlined. The RFC will provide a comprehensive blueprint for the development of the AirPollutionCaptureTree system. Additionally, the RFC will include a more detailed breakdown of tasks that can be delegated to team members, a timeline for task completion, and a plan for testing and validation. This revised RFC is now ready for implementation. However, it would be beneficial to further delve into the specifics of energy management and maintenance considerations, including potential energy sources, battery life, and replacement part design. Also, consider including research on existing technologies in air pollution capture and their efficiency comparisons. The RFC will then be updated with these additional details before moving forward to the next state. ",

    "title": "System Architecture Design - Revised",
    "description": "This RFC presents a revised architecture design for the AirPollutionCaptureTree project. The proposed system incorporates a hierarchical modular tree structure for efficient pollutant capture, an energy-efficient air filtration mechanism utilizing advanced nanotechnology, and a decentralized blockchain network for data management and analysis. Real-time monitoring and analysis are also integrated. To ensure seamless operation within urban environments, the design considers integration with smart city infrastructure. The following areas will be addressed: tree structure details, air filtration mechanism specifics, smart city integration plan, data management system design, real-time monitoring and analysis strategy, energy efficiency roadmap, maintainability improvements plan. Optimization suggestions for the overall architecture are welcome. To facilitate a smooth transition to the implementation phase, it is recommended to involve the following roles: task-decomposer, project-manager, frontend-developer, backend-developer, database-specialist, devops-engineer, qa-tester, security-specialist, and technical-writer. To ensure that all parties are aligned on the next steps, it is recommended to schedule a meeting or workshop. The task has been reviewed and approved by the code-architect.",
