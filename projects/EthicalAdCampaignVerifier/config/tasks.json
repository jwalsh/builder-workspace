Defining clear ethical guidelines to be followed, with a focus on protecting user privacy, combating misinformation, and promoting fair advertising practices.\n   - Addition: Include guidelines for handling sensitive content and respecting cultural diversity.\n2. Establishing robust fact-checking standards, utilizing reliable sources and advanced AI algorithms, including a process for continual learning and improvement.\n   - Clarification: Clearly define the process of how AI learns from mistakes or inaccuracies.\n3. Support for a wide range of advertising campaigns (e.g., display ads, video ads, native ads, social media ads, etc.), with consideration for emerging ad formats.\n4. A seamless user experience that caters to both advertisers and reviewers, with intuitive interfaces, real-time feedback mechanisms, and role-based access controls.\n   - Addition: Incorporate a notification system for updates or changes in ad campaigns.\n5. Additional features or considerations such as compatibility with specific ad platforms, integrations with existing advertising systems, scalability for future updates, and a monitoring system to ensure ethical guidelines are consistently met.\n6. Identify potential challenges and propose solutions for each requirement, including data privacy concerns, misinformation propagation, and handling the vast volume of ads.\n7. Document all requirements in detail, ensuring clarity and comprehensibility, for easy handoff to the development team.\n   - Clarification: Emphasize the need for clear, concise documentation, and provide examples when appropriate.",
