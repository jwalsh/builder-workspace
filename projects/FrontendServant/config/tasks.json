    "description": "Understand the project requirements, define the overall architecture for the Backend for Frontend (BFF) pattern implementation. Identify the necessary components and services including: \n1. Data projections required for different UI views\n2. Event-driven update mechanisms (specify WebSocket or similar technology)\n3. Data caching strategies considering edge cases and performance optimizations (consider Redis or Memcached)\n4. API gateway integration for efficient communication with various services (discuss preferred option like NGINX, Kong, or Tyk)\n5. Microservices architecture to ensure scalability, maintainability, and modularity\n6. Error handling mechanisms for graceful degradation in case of failures (specify error types and proposed mitigation strategies)\n7. Consider the use of monitoring and logging tools for debugging and troubleshooting (list potential tools like ELK stack, Prometheus, or Grafana)\n8. Document the design decisions and rationale in a technical write-up\n9. Assign tasks to frontend-developer and backend-developer team members based on the architecture design.\n10. Schedule regular meetings with the team to discuss progress and address any issues.",
