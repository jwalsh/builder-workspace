This includes detailing the implant hardware (1) with focus on power source efficiency, biocompatibility improvements, and more robust wireless communication; (2) design the software architecture with separate layers for real-time control, data processing, and user interface, emphasizing performance optimization and security; (3) outline the communication protocols used between the implant, smartphone app, and cloud server, investigating potential advancements in secure data transfer; (4) specify data management strategies, including data privacy enhancements, encryption methods, and robust backup solutions; (5) address security concerns such as multi-factor authentication, authorization, and secure data transfer with a focus on best practices in cybersecurity; (6) analyze regulatory compliance requirements and ensure adherence to these standards, considering potential future regulations; (7) evaluate ethical considerations and potential risks associated with the device, investigating methods to minimize harm and maximize benefits; (8) consider future upgrades and modifications in the design, making it adaptable for technological advancements and future regulatory changes. Once completed, update the task status to 'IMPLEMENTED'. If significant changes are required, reassign this task to an appropriate team member and change the task status to 'IN_PROGRESS'. Update the 'review_comments' field with my suggestions for improvement: (1) Explore the use of energy-harvesting technologies for power source; (2) Investigate the integration of AI and machine learning algorithms into real-time control and data processing layers; (3) Consider using blockchain technology for secure data transfer and storage. Update the 'assigned_to' field to 'code-architect'.",

This includes but is not limited to encryption (use of AES-256 for sensitive data), access controls (implement role-based access control with multi-factor authentication), regular audits (scheduled monthly and post-incident audits), incident response plans (detailed procedures for handling security breaches or data leaks), compliance with GDPR, HIPAA, and other pertinent standards. The implementation should be modular, scalable, maintainable, and future-proof for updates. Additionally, consider the use of privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) such as differential privacy and federated learning to further protect user data. The architecture should also prioritize secure-by-design principles and employ threat modeling to identify potential vulnerabilities. Mention that the design will be reviewed by a third-party security auditor for certification. Update the use of PETs section to explain how federated learning will be implemented (e.g., using Horovod or TensorFlow Federated) and provide a brief explanation of differential privacy. Finally, suggest a regular review schedule for the security measures to ensure they remain effective.",
