This includes detailing the implant hardware, software components, communication protocols, data management strategies, security considerations, regulatory compliance requirements, and ethical considerations. Clearly define interfaces between different components, ensure scalability, and take into account future upgrades and modifications. (1) Detail the design of the implant hardware, including power source, biocompatibility, and wireless communication; (2) Design the software architecture with separate layers for real-time control, data processing, and user interface; (3) Outline the communication protocols used between the implant, smartphone app, and cloud server; (4) Specify data management strategies, including data privacy, encryption, and backup; (5) Address security concerns such as authentication, authorization, and secure data transfer; (6) Analyze regulatory compliance requirements and ensure adherence to these standards; (7) Evaluate ethical considerations and potential risks associated with the device; (8) Consider future upgrades and modifications in the design, making it adaptable for technological advancements. Once completed, update the task status to 'REVIEWED' or 'IMPLEMENTED', depending on the nature of the changes suggested. If significant changes are required, reassign this task to an appropriate team member and change the task status to 'IN_PROGRESS'. Update the 'review_comments' field with your suggestions for improvement if any.",
