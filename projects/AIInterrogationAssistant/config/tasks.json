    "description": "Revise and finalize the overall system architecture design focusing on modularity, maintainability, scalability, and security. The design will encompass components for speech analysis, micro-expression detection, physiological data processing, and integration with existing interrogation systems. It will prioritize compliance with relevant laws, regulations, ethical guidelines regarding privacy, consent, data protection, and the responsible use of AI in law enforcement. This task depends on Project Planning and Requirements Gathering, Legal and Ethical Review, Data Privacy and Security Assessment. The design should aim for a flexible and extensible architecture to accommodate future enhancements and modifications. It's recommended to also include an analysis of potential biases in AI decision-making, and consider methods for mitigating these biases within the design. This RFC is currently in REVIEW state and awaits feedback from the team. Upon finalization, the design will be passed on to the task-decomposer for further implementation. It's also important to emphasize the need for transparency in AI decision-making processes, considering this aspect in the design as well. This RFC is ready for the next state, so update the rfc_state field accordingly.",
