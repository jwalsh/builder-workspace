    "description": "Design the overall system architecture for FlexTimeOptimizer, including components, data flow, and integration points. This design should consider scalability, security, performance aspects, user experience, and accessibility based on gathered project requirements. The design will also need to accommodate potential future integrations with other systems such as HRMS or scheduling tools. To ensure the system is efficient and maintainable, it's recommended to follow Microservices Architecture, and to use modern technologies like Docker, Kubernetes, and GraphQL/REST APIs for backend development. Also, include detailed documentation and diagrams for easy understanding. For improved readability, break down the design into logical modules and provide a clear flow of data among them. Ensure that the design is flexible enough to accommodate changes in future requirements without compromising performance or security. Finally, consider implementing a hybrid approach of GraphQL and REST APIs based on specific use cases to achieve optimal balance between flexibility, efficiency, and ease of implementation.",

Incorporate examples and case studies for better understanding, and ensure accessibility guidelines are followed. Consider creating a structure that allows easy navigation between sections and subsections. To facilitate understanding, break down complex concepts into simpler, digestible parts. Additionally, prioritize interactivity in the documentation to enhance user experience. Collaborate with the User Interface Design team to align documentation style with the final UI design. Once the System Architecture Design, Data Model Design tasks are completed, use their details to provide more accurate and detailed technical documentation. For end-user documentation, it would be beneficial to include a step-by-step guide on how to set up an optimal work schedule based on productivity patterns and personal commitments.",
