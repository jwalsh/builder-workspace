This design should consider scalability, security, performance aspects, user experience, and accessibility based on gathered project requirements. The design will also need to accommodate potential future integrations with other systems such as HRMS or scheduling tools. To ensure the system is efficient and maintainable, it's recommended to follow Microservices Architecture, and to use modern technologies like Docker, Kubernetes, and GraphQL/REST APIs for backend development. Also, include detailed documentation and diagrams for easy understanding.",
