    "description": "Gather and document detailed requirements for the OilSpillCleanupRobot project, including functional requirements (e.g., navigation, oil detection, collection mechanisms), non-functional requirements (e.g., autonomy, durability, safety, scalability, maintainability, energy efficiency, user interface design), constraints (e.g., regulations, environmental factors, operational conditions, data security and privacy, compatibility with existing infrastructure), success criteria (e.g., cleanup efficiency, cost-effectiveness, reliability, adaptability), future upgrade considerations, and contingency plans for potential challenges such as extreme weather conditions or unexpected malfunctions. The defined scope and requirements should be detailed enough to guide the design, development, testing, and implementation phases of the project. This RFC will also include a clear definition of the project's goals and objectives, and an outline of the system architecture. The focus should be on creating a clear, comprehensive, and actionable document that can serve as a foundation for the entire project lifecycle. This RFC is currently in draft state.",
