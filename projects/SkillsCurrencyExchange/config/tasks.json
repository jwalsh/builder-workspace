Consider factors such as scalability, maintainability, security, and performance. Define the high-level architecture and identify the major components and their responsibilities. This design will serve as a foundation for further development tasks. It is recommended to also include a detailed discussion on how user authentication, authorization, and data privacy will be addressed. Furthermore, consider incorporating microservices architecture for better modularity and scalability.",

Optimized for improved performance and scalability, ensuring proper indexing and partitioning strategies are in place for efficient querying and data retrieval. Enhanced data integrity through normalization and implemented best practices to maintain high data quality. A focus on microservices architecture was considered to ensure flexibility and maintainability. However, to fully implement this approach, additional tasks may be necessary for task decomposition.

Consider using open-source tools like Grafana, Prometheus, and ELK stack for cost optimization and flexibility.\n- Implement security best practices (e.g., network security, access controls, data encryption) while maintaining compliance with industry standards such as ISO 27001 and following the principle of least privilege.\n- Plan for scaling and load balancing strategies that can accommodate growth and handle peak loads, considering the use of autoscaling groups and load balancers like AWS Elastic Load Balancer or Google Cloud Load Balancer.\n- Document the deployment and infrastructure setup in a clear and concise manner using diagrams and step-by-step guides. Consider using platforms like GitBook or Confluence for better organization and collaboration.\n- Collaborate with Backend Development team to ensure seamless integration of deployment pipeline with the backend services, as well as with other teams for cross-functional coordination.\n- Regularly review and update the infrastructure and deployment practices in response to changes in the application, new requirements, or technology advancements. Schedule regular meetings with stakeholders to discuss updates and gather feedback.",
