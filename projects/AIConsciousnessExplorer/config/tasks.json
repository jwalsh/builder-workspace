    "title": "Define Project Scope and Requirements - REVISED",
    "description": "This RFC aims to revise the project scope, objectives, and requirements for the AIConsciousnessExplorer tool. The revised document will be based on feedback from stakeholders, subject matter experts, and potential end-users. It will include identification of the target audience, use cases, and key features. The system architecture, data models, and integration points with existing systems or data sources will also be defined. Performance, scalability, security, and compliance requirements will be established. A project plan, milestones, and deliverables will be documented, ensuring the requirements are well-defined, measurable, and aligned with the project's goals. Suggested technologies for implementation phase will be discussed, along with their pros and cons, and a rationale for the chosen technology. An exploratory phase for testing and validating the chosen theories of consciousness is included. Subtasks may be created for efficient delegation. A timeline for each milestone is provided, and the project's progress can be easily tracked. This updated RFC also includes a section for potential risks and mitigation strategies, and clearly defines the success criteria for the project. It is suggested that this task be reassigned to the Project Manager for further development.",

    "title": "Design System Architecture for AIConsciousnessExplorer",
    "description": "Design the overall system architecture for the AIConsciousnessExplorer tool, including components, modules, their interactions, and the data flow. The design should emphasize modularity, scalability, performance optimization, error handling, and maintainability. The architecture should support the integration of various consciousness theories and simulation models, as well as the ability to add new theories and models in the future. Additionally, it should include a user interface for researchers to interact with the system, configure simulations, and analyze results. Ensure the design follows best practices for each component (e.g., frontend, backend, database).\n\nFor this RFC, consider breaking down the architecture into more specific subtasks:\n- Frontend Architecture Design: Design the user interface (UI) and its interactions, considering responsiveness, accessibility, and performance.\n   - Backend Architecture Design: Design the server-side logic, APIs, and services.\n   - Database Architecture Design: Design the database schema, data storage strategies, and querying mechanisms.\n   - System Integration and API Design: Design the interconnections between frontend, backend, and potential third-party integrations.\n   - Testing Strategy and Requirements: Define testing methods for each component of the system, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.\n   - Security Considerations throughout the system design: Ensure secure data handling, authentication, authorization, and protection against common web vulnerabilities.\n\nThese subtasks will facilitate a more granular review process and implementation. Update the task depending on the current state of these subtasks. I have added requirements for testing and security throughout the system design as suggested in your comments.\n\nAlso, consider adding milestones and deadlines for each subtask to ensure timely progress.\n\nPlease assign this RFC to 'task-decomposer' for further decomposition into smaller, manageable tasks. Additionally, I recommend assigning the Frontend Architecture Design task to a 'Frontend-Developer' when it is decomposed.",
