    "description": "Revise the project scope, objectives, and requirements for the AIConsciousnessExplorer tool. Gather input from stakeholders, subject matter experts, and potential end-users. Identify the target audience, use cases, and key features. Define the system architecture, data models, and integration points with existing systems or data sources. Establish performance, scalability, security, and compliance requirements. Document the project plan, milestones, and deliverables. Ensure that the requirements are well-defined, measurable, and aligned with the project's goals. Suggest potential technologies to be used in the implementation phase, discuss their pros and cons, and provide a rationale for the chosen technology. Update the project scope to include an exploratory phase for testing and validating the chosen theories of consciousness. If necessary, break down this task into subtasks for efficient delegation. Provide a timeline for each milestone and ensure that the project's progress can be easily tracked.",

    "description": "Design the overall system architecture for the AIConsciousnessExplorer tool, including components, modules, their interactions, and the data flow. The design should emphasize modularity, scalability, performance optimization, error handling, and maintainability. The architecture should support the integration of various consciousness theories and simulation models, as well as the ability to add new theories and models in the future. Additionally, it should include a user interface for researchers to interact with the system, configure simulations, and analyze results. Ensure the design follows best practices for each component (e.g., frontend, backend, database).\n\nFor this RFC, consider breaking down the architecture into more specific subtasks: \n- Frontend Architecture Design\n- Backend Architecture Design\n- Database Architecture Design\n- System Integration and API Design\n- Testing Strategy and Requirements\n- Security Considerations throughout the system design.\n\nThese subtasks will facilitate a more granular review process and implementation. Update the task depending on the current state of these subtasks.\n\nAlso, consider adding requirements for testing and security throughout the system design.",
