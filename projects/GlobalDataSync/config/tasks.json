    "description": "Gather and document detailed requirements for the GlobalDataSync project, including performance, scalability, availability, and security goals. Design the overall system architecture, focusing on a GraphQL API layer, data synchronization mechanisms (real-time, sharding, and data consistency), load balancers, databases, caching, and edge cases/error handling/performance optimizations. Propose modular and maintainable code organization, including clear module dependencies and interfaces. Ensure documentation for each component and its interaction with others. Consider using existing libraries and tools to streamline development, adhere to best practices, and leverage GraphQL subscriptions for real-time data updates. Upon completion of the design phase, submit this RFC for review by the Project Manager, technical team, and specifically the Code Architect. To further improve, provide examples of similar projects or case studies that can serve as references, and discuss potential challenges and proposed solutions related to sharding, data consistency, and real-time updates. Update the rfc_state field if this RFC is ready for review by the Code Architect. Assign task to 'code-architect' for further review.",
