    "description": "Gather and document detailed requirements for the GlobalDataSync project, including performance, scalability, availability, and security goals. Design the overall system architecture, including the GraphQL API layer, data synchronization mechanisms (considering real-time, sharding, and data consistency), and infrastructure components (such as load balancers, databases, and caching). Ensure that the architecture considers edge cases, error handling, and performance optimizations. Outline a plan for modular and maintainable code organization, including clear module dependencies and interfaces. Provide documentation for each component and its interaction with others. Consider using existing libraries and tools to streamline development and ensure compliance with best practices.",
