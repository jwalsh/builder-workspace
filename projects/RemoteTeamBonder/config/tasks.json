    "description": "Define project scope, goals, and requirements for the RemoteTeamBonder platform. This includes identifying key features (such as virtual meetings, collaborative whiteboarding, icebreaker games, chat functionalities), user roles (developers, team leaders, HR managers), data models (user profiles, activities logs, feedback system), technical requirements (scalability, security, real-time communication), potential integrations with existing tools for the platform, to foster connections and team spirit among remote and distributed workforce. The RFC will also outline the project timeline and resource allocation, and provide a high-level design of the platform architecture, considering aspects such as frontend, backend, database, and devops. The RFC will also include a detailed security plan focusing on data protection, user authentication, and authorization. The RFC will be updated regularly to reflect any changes in requirements or timeline.",

    "description": "Design the overall system architecture focusing on microservices for improved modularity and scalability. This includes defining components, data flow, integration points, and infrastructure requirements. Consider scalability, security, and performance aspects. Incorporate containerization technologies such as Docker and Kubernetes. AWS or Azure cloud hosting is recommended due to their robustness, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. For the frontend, ReactJS and Redux could be considered due to their popularity and flexibility. For the backend, Node.js with Express and MongoDB might be a good choice for its scalability and ease of development. Consider using GraphQL for API queries and mutations. Additionally, ensure that the architecture design includes proper logging, monitoring, and alerting mechanisms. To enhance security, consider implementing OAuth2 or JWT for user authentication and authorization. For improved team collaboration, integrate Slack or Microsoft Teams APIs. Lastly, suggest a CI/CD pipeline using tools like Jenkins, Travis CI, or CircleCI.",
