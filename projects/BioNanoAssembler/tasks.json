The design should include components, interfaces, data flow, integration points with external systems or services. Consider scalability, maintainability, performance requirements, security, fault tolerance, edge cases, error handling, and performance optimizations. Provide a detailed architecture diagram, documentation, and a comprehensive test plan for validation of the proposed architecture. Identify key subsystems or modules, specify the communication protocols and data formats between components, outline any necessary APIs or services for integration with third-party tools, and update the architecture to accommodate potential future growth and evolving project requirements. Include a section detailing how the design addresses privacy concerns and compliance with relevant industry standards. Update the documentation to provide clear guidance on software configuration management, version control, and deployment strategies.",
