Provide a detailed architecture diagram, documentation, and a comprehensive test plan for validation of the proposed architecture. Identify key subsystems or modules, specify the communication protocols and data formats between components, and outline any necessary APIs or services for integration with third-party tools. Update the architecture to accommodate potential future growth and evolving project requirements.",
