The design should include components, interfaces, data flow, integration points with external systems or services, considering scalability, maintainability, performance requirements, security, fault tolerance, edge cases, error handling, and performance optimizations. Provide a detailed architecture diagram, documentation, and a comprehensive test plan for validation of the proposed architecture. Identify key subsystems or modules, specify the communication protocols and data formats between components, outline any necessary APIs or services for integration with third-party tools. Update the architecture to accommodate potential future growth and evolving project requirements. Include a section detailing how the design addresses privacy concerns and compliance with relevant industry standards. Ensure seamless integration with both frontend and backend components, as well as databases and external services. Consider implementing a modular architecture that allows for easy maintenance and future expansion. If there are any dependencies that need to be addressed before starting the implementation phase, please specify them clearly. Additionally, provide guidelines on software configuration management, version control, and deployment strategies within the documentation. In case of any changes in project requirements or dependencies, update the task accordingly. Upon completion, please share the updated architecture design with the team for review.",

The system will handle molecular models, simulation data, manufacturing instructions, and other relevant data efficiently, supporting retrieval, versioning, backup, and disaster recovery mechanisms. It will comply with data privacy and security regulations, offering real-time monitoring, access controls, audit logs, and disaster recovery capabilities. Collaborate with the assigned team members for system architecture design, data format standardization, and compatibility with existing project infrastructure. Upon completion of the design phase, conduct a thorough review to validate the architecture and ensure scalability, performance, and adherence to best practices. Once approved, proceed to implementation. Incorporate additional features such as data compression for efficient storage and retrieval, support for big data analysis tools like TensorFlow and scikit-learn, and integration with cloud services for scalable data storage and accessibility. Engage with third-party consultants or academic institutions if necessary for emerging technologies in this field. Upon completion of the implementation phase, a comprehensive testing phase will follow, including stress tests, security audits, and usability tests to validate system functionality and performance. Update the rfc_state to 'REVISED'.",
