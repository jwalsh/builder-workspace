The design should include components, interfaces, data flow, integration points with external systems or services, considering scalability, maintainability, performance requirements, security, fault tolerance, edge cases, error handling, and performance optimizations. Provide a detailed architecture diagram, documentation, and a comprehensive test plan for validation of the proposed architecture. Identify key subsystems or modules, specify the communication protocols and data formats between components, outline any necessary APIs or services for integration with third-party tools, and update the architecture to accommodate potential future growth and evolving project requirements. Include a section detailing how the design addresses privacy concerns and compliance with relevant industry standards. Update the documentation to provide clear guidance on software configuration management, version control, and deployment strategies. Pay special attention to ensuring seamless integration with both frontend and backend components, as well as databases and external services. Furthermore, consider implementing a modular architecture that allows for easy maintenance and future expansion. In case of any changes in project requirements or dependencies, update the task accordingly. If there are any dependencies that need to be addressed before starting the implementation phase, please specify them clearly.",

Include features such as real-time monitoring, access controls, audit logs, and disaster recovery capabilities. Collaborate with the assigned team members for system architecture design, data format standardization, and ensure compatibility with the existing project infrastructure. Upon completion of the design phase, conduct a thorough review to validate the architecture and ensure scalability, performance, and adherence to best practices. Upon approval, proceed to implementation. Include the following additional features: data compression for efficient storage and retrieval, support for big data analysis tools such as TensorFlow and scikit-learn, and integration with cloud services for scalable data storage and accessibility. If necessary, engage with third-party consultants or collaborate with academic institutions for emerging technologies in this field. Upon completion of the implementation phase, conduct a thorough testing phase to validate the system's functionality and performance, including stress tests and security audits.",
