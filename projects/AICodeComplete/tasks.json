    "description": "Define the project scope, objectives, requirements, and high-level architecture for the AI-powered code completion system. This should include the following key areas: 1) Identifying the target programming languages and frameworks to support (e.g., Python, JavaScript, Java), 2) Defining the user interface and interaction model for code completion suggestions (e.g., autocomplete dropdown, inline suggestions with customizable behavior), 3) Determining the required data sources and preprocessing steps for training the AI model (e.g., public APIs, popular open-source code repositories, programming books, and online coding challenges), 4) Outlining the AI model architecture and components (e.g., language model, code generation model, code refactoring module with support for multiple coding styles), 5) Specifying the integration points with IDEs and code editors (e.g., Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, Sublime Text through plugins and APIs), 6) Defining the deployment and scaling strategy for serving the AI model (e.g., containerization using Docker or Kubernetes, cloud services like AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions), 7) Identifying potential challenges and risks (e.g., handling large codebases with efficient indexing, ensuring code quality and security through static analysis tools, managing model updates with version control and automatic retraining, dealing with code complexity and diversity by incorporating abstract syntax trees and type systems), 8) Providing a plan for evaluating and iterating on the system based on user feedback, usability studies, and A/B testing. Also, consider exploring opportunities for collaboration with popular IDEs and code editors to enhance their built-in code completion features.\n\n**Update**: Assign this task to the Code Architect for a more detailed analysis of AI model architecture and components.",

    "description": "Design the overall system architecture for the AICodeComplete system, incorporating the following components and their interactions: 1) Code Editor Interface, 2) Context Analyzer, 3) Deep Learning Model, 4) Code Suggestion Engine, 5) Data Storage, 6) Model Training Pipeline. The design should address scalability, performance, fault tolerance, security, and maintainability aspects. Provide a high-level diagram and detailed component descriptions, including technologies, frameworks, and design patterns to be used (e.g., using React for frontend, Flask or Django for backend, PyTorch/TensorFlow for deep learning, PostgreSQL for data storage). Address potential challenges related to real-time code completion, model performance, handling large codebases, and model retraining/updates. Incorporate multi-tenancy support, multiple programming language support, IDE/code editor integration, API for third-party tool integration, and ensure the architecture supports incremental deployment and rollback strategies, as well as monitoring and logging capabilities. The design should also consider the following additional aspects: 1) Multi-tenancy support for different users or projects, 2) Support for multiple programming languages, 3) Integration with popular IDEs and code editors, 4) API for third-party tool integration. This task will be broken down into smaller tasks for easier implementation. Upon completion, update the rfc_state field to 'IMPLEMENTATION_IN_PROGRESS'.",
