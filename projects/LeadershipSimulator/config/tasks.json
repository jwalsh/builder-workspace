    "description": "Thoroughly define the scope, features, and target audience for the LeadershipSimulator platform. This includes conducting stakeholder interviews, researching existing solutions, documenting functional and non-functional requirements, exploring potential future enhancements, scalability considerations, usability aspects, and accessibility concerns. The final documentation will serve as a comprehensive guide for the development team, product management, and any other relevant parties. To ensure a comprehensive understanding of the project's needs, it is recommended to involve all relevant stakeholders in the requirements gathering process, including subject matter experts, designers, potential users, and accessibility specialists (to specifically address accessibility concerns). The revised task description also includes an emphasis on accessibility to cater to a wide range of users. Since this task is crucial to the success of the project, it is essential that all feedback received during the review process be carefully considered. To streamline the requirements gathering process and ensure thoroughness, consider breaking down the tasks into smaller, manageable parts (task decomposition) and assign specific team members for each part. The final documentation will serve as a blueprint for the entire project, guiding all future development decisions.",
