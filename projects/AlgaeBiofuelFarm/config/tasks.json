    "title": "Revised Requirements Gathering and Analysis",
    "description": "This task involves gathering and analyzing comprehensive requirements for the Algae Biofuel Farm system. Key areas of focus include cultivation methods, conversion processes, optimization goals, data management needs, security considerations, scalability requirements, environmental impact assessment, preliminary architecture design outlining key interfaces between different components such as sensors, actuators, control systems, and data storage, a detailed breakdown of each requirement with rationale, acceptance criteria, and potential dependencies. The revised task includes a focus on the integration of AI and machine learning for optimizing cultivation and conversion processes. Additionally, the task aims to establish clear communication channels among team members and stakeholders throughout the requirements gathering process, ensure that these requirements are properly documented for future reference, and review current industry standards in algae cultivation and biofuel production to ensure our solution remains competitive and cutting-edge. The task will be broken down into subtasks for easier tracking and completion. Notable additions include a section on user experience design, considering the operators who will interact with the system on a daily basis, and a review of potential partnerships or collaborations that could benefit the project. Upon completion, a comprehensive requirements document will be provided for implementation. The rfc_state field should be updated to 'IN PROGRESS' once the task has been decomposed into subtasks. For further improvement, consider adding specific timelines and milestones for each subtask, as well as setting up regular progress updates to keep all stakeholders informed.",
