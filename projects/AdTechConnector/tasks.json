    "description": "Design the overall system architecture, including components, data flow, integration points, and key considerations for scalability, security, and performance. The architecture should address the following aspects:\n\n1. Real-time bidding system: Design a scalable and low-latency system for handling real-time biding requests and responses, including components like load balancers, message queues, and bidding engines.\n2. Private network connectivity: Incorporate secure and high-performance private network connections (e.g., VPNs, dedicated circuits) for data exchange between advertising platforms and the real-time bidding system. Consider network topology, redundancy, and performance optimization. Implement traffic shaping to control network congestion in peak times.\n3. Data processing pipeline: Define the pipeline for ingesting, processing, and storing advertising data, including bid requests, bid responses, and campaign performance metrics. Consider stream processing, batch processing, and data transformation components. Implement a mechanism for handling failed or malformed data.\n4. Data storage and management: Determine the appropriate data storage solutions (e.g., relational databases, NoSQL databases, data lakes) and data management strategies (e.g., partitioning, indexing, caching) for efficient data access and analysis. Implement a data retention policy to ensure compliance with regulations.\n5. Security and compliance: Implement robust security measures, such as encryption (in-transit and at-rest), access controls, auditing, and secure coding practices, to ensure data privacy and compliance with relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA). Perform regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing.\n6. Monitoring and logging: Incorporate monitoring and logging mechanisms for system health, performance, and troubleshooting, including metrics collection, alerting, and log aggregation and analysis. Implement anomaly detection to identify potential security threats or system issues.\n7. Scalability and high availability: Design the architecture to handle varying traffic loads and ensure high availability through load balancing, auto-scaling, and failover mechanisms (e.g., active-active or active-passive configurations). Implement a mechanism for automatic scaling based on specific performance metrics.\n8. Integration and APIs: Define the integration points and APIs (e.g., REST, gRPC) for advertising platforms to connect to the real-time bidding system and exchange data, including API versioning, documentation, and developer portals. Implement rate limiting and access controls to prevent abuse.\n9. Deployment and infrastructure: Consider the deployment and infrastructure requirements, such as cloud or on-premises hosting, containerization, and infrastructure as code (IaC) for consistent and automated deployments. Implement a configuration management system for consistency across environments.\n10. Testing and quality assurance: Incorporate testing strategies, including unit testing, integration testing, load testing, and security testing, to ensure the system's reliability, performance, and security. Establish a testing pipeline for continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD).",
