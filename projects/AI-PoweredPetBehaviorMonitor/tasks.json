Conduct extensive research on pet behavior, AI techniques (machine learning, computer vision), existing solutions in the field of pet behavior monitoring and training, and emerging technologies that could be leveraged.\n3. Gather input from a diverse group of stakeholders including pet owners, trainers, veterinarians, AI experts, software developers, and pet-related organizations.\n4. Collaborate with project manager to prioritize tasks, allocate resources based on the defined requirements, and create a detailed timeline for project completion.\n5. Document all findings, recommendations, and insights in a clear, concise, and easily understandable manner for all team members and stakeholders.\n6. Regularly update the progress of research and gatherings to ensure alignment with project goals.\n7. Once the requirements are fully understood and documented, work closely with the task-decomposer to break down the tasks into manageable units.",
