    "description": "Design the overall system architecture, including the data model, application logic, and user interface components. The architecture should consider the following aspects: 1) Separation of concerns between the front-end, back-end, and data layers (following SOLID principles). 2) Modular design to allow for easy maintenance and scalability (using microservices architecture where appropriate). 3) Integration with existing HR systems and data sources (specifically mention the systems like HRIS, ATS, Payroll systems, and provide APIs or protocols for integration). 4) Support for different user roles and access controls (define these roles such as Employee, Manager, Admin, Super Admin, and specify the permissions for each role). 5) Robust error handling and logging mechanisms (include a centralized logging system). 6) Performance optimizations for handling large datasets (provide some best practices or specific strategies, such as using indexes, caching, and pagination). 7) Consideration of data privacy and security measures (implement end-to-end encryption, enforce strict access controls, follow OWASP guidelines). 8) Document the architecture design in a clear and concise manner for easy understanding and implementation (use UML diagrams where necessary, write comprehensive technical documentation). 9) Implement unit tests and integration tests to ensure the robustness of the system. 10) Assess the system's impact on the existing infrastructure and provide recommendations for necessary upgrades or enhancements.",

Also, ensure that the database design aligns well with the overall system architecture. Suggest a database management system (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) that best fits our needs considering performance, scalability, and data model complexity. Additionally, consider sharding strategies to handle large datasets if necessary.",
