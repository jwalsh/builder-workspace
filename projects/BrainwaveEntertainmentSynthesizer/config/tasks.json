    "description": "This RFC outlines the process for gathering and documenting the project requirements for the BrainwaveEntertainmentSynthesizer. The focus areas include: 1) Desired features (e.g., real-time content generation, user personalization, customizable preferences), 2) User experience considerations (e.g., intuitive interface, responsive design, accessibility), 3) Technical specifications (e.g., hardware, software, APIs), 4) Data privacy and security considerations (e.g., anonymized data storage, secure communication protocols, compliance with regulations), 5) Scalability and performance requirements (e.g., handling high traffic, ensuring low latency), 6) Integration with existing systems (if any) such as EEG devices or AI models, and 7) Future-proofing the system for potential updates and improvements. This task will help guide the development of the BrainwaveEntertainmentSynthesizer.",
