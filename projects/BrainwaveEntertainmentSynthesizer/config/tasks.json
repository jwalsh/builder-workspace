    "description": "This RFC outlines the process for gathering and documenting the project requirements for the Brainwave Entertainment Synthesizer. The focus areas include: 1) Desired features (e.g., real-time content generation, user personalization, customizable preferences), 2) User experience considerations (e.g., intuitive interface, responsive design, accessibility), 3) Technical specifications (e.g., hardware, software, APIs), 4) Data privacy and security considerations (e.g., anonymized data storage, secure communication protocols, compliance with regulations such as GDPR, CCPA), 5) Scalability and performance requirements (e.g., handling high traffic, ensuring low latency, considering potential edge computing solutions), 6) Integration with existing systems (if any) such as EEG devices, AI models, or APIs, and 7) Future-proofing the system for potential updates and improvements. This task will help guide the development of the Brainwave Entertainment Synthesizer. After completion, this RFC will serve as a foundation for subsequent tasks and will be updated throughout the project lifecycle. To ensure the successful implementation of this project, it is crucial to involve all necessary stakeholders in the requirements gathering process. This includes frontend-developer, backend-developer, database-specialist, devops-engineer, QA-tester, security-specialist, and technical-writer, among others. Once the project requirements are clearly defined and documented, they will be prioritized based on their impact on the overall system and user experience. The project team will then work towards implementing these requirements in an iterative manner, with regular feedback and adjustments throughout the development process. This task is now ready for implementation. I suggest updating the 'rfc_state' field to 'IMPLEMENTATION_PENDING'. Additionally, since you are the assigned person, ensure that this task is delegated to the appropriate team members based on their expertise.",
