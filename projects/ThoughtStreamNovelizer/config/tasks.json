The interface should include a tutorial or guided onboarding process for new users, and be accessible to people with different abilities. The design should also incorporate feedback mechanisms allowing users to rate their experience and provide suggestions for improvement. The interface's aesthetics should reflect the creativity and personal nature of the generated literature. The revised UI design should take into account the dependencies mentioned, particularly Requirements Gathering and Analysis and BCI Safety Mechanisms Design.",
