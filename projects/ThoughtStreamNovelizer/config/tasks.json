The revised interface should allow users to easily initiate, control, and safely terminate the brain-computer interface (BCI), as well as view, manage, and export the generated narrative content in various formats (e.g., text, audio, video). The interface should include a tutorial or guided onboarding process for new users, be accessible to people with different abilities, and incorporate feedback mechanisms allowing users to rate their experience and provide suggestions for improvement. The interface's aesthetics should reflect the creativity and personal nature of the generated literature. The revised UI design should take into account the dependencies mentioned, particularly Requirements Gathering and Analysis and BCI Safety Mechanisms Design. Additionally, consider incorporating real-time monitoring tools to ensure user safety and comfort during operation, and ensure the interface is responsive across various devices. The design should also prioritize privacy and security of user data. To facilitate efficient collaboration and streamlined development process, include a feature for real-time team communication within the interface. Lastly, update the design regularly based on user feedback and evolving technologies.",
