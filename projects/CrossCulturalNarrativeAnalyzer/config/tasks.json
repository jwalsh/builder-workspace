    "description": "Revise and update the requirements for the CrossCulturalNarrativeAnalyzer tool. The revised document should include the following: 1. Types of literary works to be analyzed (novels, short stories, poetry, etc.), 2. Cultural and linguistic diversity to be covered (specific languages or regions), 3. Desired analysis outputs (theme identification, unique cultural elements, cross-cultural adaptation potential, etc.), 4. Target users (scholars, writers, publishers, etc.), and 5. Any additional considerations or constraints that may affect the tool's design or functionality. This revised document will serve as a foundation for further project development.",

    "description": "Design the overall system architecture, including data pipeline, analysis engines, user interfaces, and integration with external data sources and libraries. Key aspects to consider: 1) Data ingestion and preprocessing for various file formats and languages, 2) Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning models for text analysis, 3) Scalable and distributed architecture for handling large volumes of data, 4) User interfaces for exploration, analysis, and visualization of data, 5) Integration with external data sources such as literary databases, cultural knowledge bases, 6) Security and privacy considerations for sensitive cultural data, 7) Deployment strategies for continuous integration and delivery, considering DevOps. The following improvements are suggested: a) Break down the task into smaller, manageable subtasks for efficient progress tracking. b) Include a timeline for each subtask and set clear milestones for regular updates. c) Consider using open-source libraries and tools to reduce development time and costs. d) Collaborate with a team of experts in NLP, machine learning, databases, frontend/backend development, DevOps, and security. e) Establish an iterative design process that allows for feedback from stakeholders throughout the project. To reflect these changes, update the 'dependencies' field to include: 'Break down task into subtasks', 'Establish timeline and milestones', 'Choose open-source libraries and tools', 'Build cross-functional team', and 'Implement iterative design process'. If the suggested changes are agreed upon, set the 'rfc_state' to 'REVIEWING'.",
