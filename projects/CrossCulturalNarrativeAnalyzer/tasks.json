    "description": "Revise and update the requirements for the CrossCulturalNarrativeAnalyzer tool. The revised document should include the following: 1. Types of literary works to be analyzed (novels, short stories, poetry, etc.), 2. Cultural and linguistic diversity to be covered (specific languages or regions), 3. Desired analysis outputs (theme identification, unique cultural elements, cross-cultural adaptation potential, etc.), 4. Target users (scholars, writers, publishers, etc.), and 5. Any additional considerations or constraints that may affect the tool's design or functionality. This revised document will serve as a foundation for further project development.",
