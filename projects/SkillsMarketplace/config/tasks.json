    "description": "Revise and expand the requirements for the SkillsMarketplace platform. This includes a comprehensive analysis of user roles, features, and functionality. The revised document will cover both functional and non-functional requirements such as performance, scalability, security, accessibility, data privacy, and any other organizational policies or constraints. Involve all relevant stakeholders (e.g., HR, legal, security) to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the platform's needs. Once complete, share with the project team for feedback before finalizing. The revised document should also include user interface design considerations, integration points with existing systems, and any potential third-party services that may be required. Upon completion, assign to the 'project-manager' for further action.",

Provide a detailed architecture diagram, documentation, and ensure that the design is microservices-oriented with clear separation of concerns for frontend, backend, database, and infrastructure components. Consider implementing technologies like Kubernetes for orchestration, GraphQL/REST APIs for communication between services, and serverless functions where appropriate. In addition, suggest potential candidate technologies for each component that are well-suited to the project requirements, such as React for frontend, Node.js with Express.js for backend, MongoDB for NoSQL database, and AWS Lambda for serverless functions.",
