    "description": "Gather, document and refine functional and non-functional requirements for the UtopianSocietyDesigner platform. This includes defining user stories, use cases, system constraints, key performance indicators (KPIs), and outlining expected features such as simulation complexity levels, societal structure types, data visualization options, collaboration tools, and the user interface design. Document any potential technical limitations and constraints that may impact the project, and consider accessibility and usability factors. Also, provide suggestions for integrating machine learning algorithms to improve user experience. Document this revised RFC clearly and concisely, ensuring all necessary details are included. Update the task if needed when complete.",

    "description": "Define the overall system architecture for the Utopian Society Designer platform. This includes detailed specifications of the frontend, backend, database, and infrastructure components. The architecture should prioritize scalability, maintainability, and modularity to accommodate future growth and changes. Ensure proper separation of concerns and adherence to industry best practices such as microservices architecture. Consider the use of containerization (Docker) and cloud-native technologies (AWS or Google Cloud) for deployment and management. The data flow diagram should be included in the RFC for better understanding of the proposed system, along with a clear definition of API endpoints and their usage. It would also be beneficial to outline the data storage strategies, including any necessary indexing and caching strategies to ensure optimal performance.",
