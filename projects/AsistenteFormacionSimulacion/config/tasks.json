This includes desired features, target audience (educators, trainees in specific industries), use cases (various training scenarios), technical constraints (hardware compatibility, software limitations), integration with existing LMS systems (e.g., Moodle, Canvas), security considerations (data privacy, authentication mechanisms), performance requirements (minimum frame rate, latency limits), scalability needs (number of concurrent users, expansion to multiple platforms), potential future enhancements (VR headset upgrades, haptic feedback integration), user experience design (intuitive interfaces, accessibility features), and accessibility in the design (support for color blindness, hearing impairment).",

    "description": "In this revised task, we aim to design an intuitive, efficient, accessible, and user-friendly interface and experience for both trainers and trainees within the virtual reality-based training platform. The design will take into account various user roles, accessibility guidelines, usability best practices, project scope, requirements, branding, and visual identity. It will align with the overall project vision and be flexible enough to accommodate future updates. Upon completion, comprehensive documentation of the design decisions and interface elements will be provided. To ensure a smooth operation within the VR environment, we recommend considering performance aspects during the design process. The revised design prioritizes usability, accessibility, and flexibility. We request feedback on this updated description, specifically focusing on the following areas: 1) Clarify if the design should also take into account the performance aspect to ensure smooth operation within the VR environment. 2) Highlight any potential areas that require unique considerations due to the nature of the VR-based training platform (e.g., motion sickness, spatial disorientation). 3) Suggest any additional dependencies or related tasks that need to be considered for a comprehensive design, such as feedback mechanisms, interaction design, and error handling strategies. We will then address your feedback before moving forward. After addressing your feedback, we would like the task to be moved to the 'Implementation' state.",
