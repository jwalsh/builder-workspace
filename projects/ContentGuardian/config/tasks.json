    "description": "Gather and document the project requirements, including the types of content to be moderated (e.g., text, images, videos), target industries (e.g., social media, e-commerce, healthcare), and desired level of moderation (e.g., profanity filtering, explicit content detection, personal information redaction). Identify key stakeholders (content moderators, legal/compliance teams, end-users) and their specific needs. Consider scalability, performance, and compliance requirements for each industry. Detail any specific regional or local regulations that might apply, focusing on privacy and data protection standards. Break down the project into smaller tasks for better management and to facilitate collaboration among team members. Prioritize user privacy, data protection, and efficiency of the moderation process. Provide a clear timeline, milestones, and deliverables for each task. Include specific objectives for the initial Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and future enhancements in the project scope. Update this RFC with an appropriate timeline, considering dependencies on other tasks or RFCs. If necessary, suggest potential task-decompositions that may address any dependencies or improve collaboration. Update the 'assigned_to' field to 'project-manager'.",

    "title": "Design System Architecture for ContentGuardian (Revised)",
    "description": "Design the overall system architecture for ContentGuardian, a serverless content moderation system. The revised architecture will include the following components: 1) Ingestion layer for accepting user-contributed content from various sources with built-in error handling and rate limiting, 2) Processing layer for content analysis, moderation, and filtering, including edge cases such as deepfakes and inappropriate language detection, with a focus on using AI/ML algorithms to improve performance and accuracy. This layer will also include a feedback mechanism allowing users to appeal decisions. 3) Storage layer for persisting moderated content and metadata using a combination of object storage (for scalability) and relational databases (for querying), ensuring data durability, security, and compliance with industry standards and regulations. The storage layer should also include version control for content and support for data anonymization when required. 4) Notification and reporting mechanisms with real-time alerts and periodic reports, including options for customizable report formats and integrations with popular analytics platforms. 5) Integration points with third-party services or APIs as required, such as OCR for scanning images and videos, a flexible API gateway to manage these connections, and a mechanism for handling updates in third-party service APIs. The solution will be modular, with clear boundaries between components and consideration given to ease of maintenance and upgrading. Document the architecture using UML diagrams, sequence diagrams, and flowcharts. Provide a detailed explanation, including any necessary trade-offs and design decisions. This RFC is ready for implementation; assign it to the appropriate team member(s).",
