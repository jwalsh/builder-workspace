    "description": "Design the overall system architecture for ContentGuardian, a serverless content moderation system. The architecture should include the following components: 1) Ingestion layer for accepting user-contributed content from various sources, 2) Processing layer for content analysis, moderation, and filtering, 3) Storage layer for persisting moderated content and metadata, 4) Notification and reporting mechanisms, 5) Integration points with third-party services or APIs as required. Ensure scalability, reliability, security, and compliance with industry standards and regulations. Consider edge cases, error handling, and performance optimizations. Document the architecture using industry-standard notation (e.g., UML diagrams) and provide a detailed explanation, including any necessary trade-offs and design decisions. The solution should be modular for easy maintenance and upgrading, with clear boundaries between components. This RFC is ready for implementation; assign it to the appropriate team member(s).",
