    "description": "Define project scope, objectives, and requirements. Engage with stakeholders and subject matter experts to understand compensation equity analysis needs. Identify data sources (both internal and external), legal and regulatory requirements, key performance indicators (KPIs) for measuring equity, potential machine learning algorithms that can be used for the analysis, consider the implications of bias in compensation practices, and prioritize features based on their impact on fairness and equitability. Additionally, document these findings in a clear and concise manner to facilitate communication and decision-making.",

    "description": "Design the overall system architecture, including data ingestion, processing, analysis, reporting components, and security considerations. The architecture should be modular, scalable, maintainable, and efficient in terms of performance, error handling, and edge cases. Consider using microservices for better modularity and scalability. To ensure a robust solution, I recommend the following improvements: 1. Incorporate data validation checks to ensure the integrity of the ingested data. 2. Implement data encryption at rest and in transit for security purposes. 3. Design the system with a focus on fault-tolerance and failover mechanisms. 4. Use containerization technologies like Docker or Kubernetes for easier deployment, scaling, and management. 5. Define clear APIs for easy integration with other systems within the organization. Additionally, consider implementing data versioning and auditing to maintain data integrity and traceability. For improved maintainability, implement monitoring and logging mechanisms. Consider incorporating AI/ML techniques for advanced analysis tasks. For better user experience, consider a clean and intuitive frontend design. To facilitate collaboration among team members, use version control systems like Git and collaborative tools like Jira or Confluence.",
