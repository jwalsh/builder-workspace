    "description": "Gather and document detailed requirements for the EmotionalAtmosphereMonitor project. This includes specifying types of sensors (facial expression recognition, sound analysis, body language), emotional states to be monitored (happiness, anger, sadness, fear, surprise, disgust), preferred visualization methods (dashboard, real-time graphical representation, AI-generated interpretations, potentially incorporating VR/AR for immersive experiences), and any specific constraints or regulations to be considered (privacy concerns, compliance with local laws, data security, emphasizing on anonymity and aggregation of data). Consider the potential need for a mobile app, suggesting minimal features such as real-time feed and configurable alerts. Outline the minimum viable product (MVP) features, focusing on real-time monitoring and basic visualization. Suggest potential integration points with existing systems or APIs, providing examples where possible (OpenCV, TensorFlow, OpenDataSoft). Recommend a framework for AI models (TensorFlow or PyTorch), specify any performance requirements for real-time processing (30 FPS minimum), and suggest a deep learning model architecture for facial expression recognition. Incorporate the need for data normalization and preprocessing in sensor data collection to ensure accuracy. Also, include the potential need for machine learning models for sound analysis and consider the use of convolutional neural networks (CNN) for this purpose. Lastly, emphasize the importance of regular testing and validation to ensure accuracy and reliability, suggesting unit tests, integration tests, and user acceptance testing (UAT). Update the rfc_state field to 'READY_FOR_APPROVAL' when reviewed.",

    "description": "Design the overall system architecture, including the sensor network, data collection and processing pipelines, AI models for emotion detection, visualization components, and integration with existing infrastructure. This task involves defining a scalable, secure, and efficient system design that emphasizes modularity, extensibility, and adaptability to future upgrades or additions. The design should take into account potential impact on user privacy and ensure compliance with relevant data protection regulations. Additionally, outline the plan for handling large volumes of data, including strategies for real-time processing, data compression, and storage optimization. Specify the system's fault tolerance mechanisms to minimize downtime in case of hardware or software failures, focusing particularly on redundancy, failover, and self-healing capabilities. The design should also address edge computing for improved responsiveness and reduced latency.",
