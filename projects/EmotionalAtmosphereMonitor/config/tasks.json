    "description": "Gather and document detailed requirements for the EmotionalAtmosphereMonitor project. This includes specifying types of sensors (facial expression recognition, sound analysis, body language), emotional states to be monitored (happiness, anger, sadness, fear, surprise, disgust), preferred visualization methods (dashboard, real-time graphical representation, AI-generated interpretations), and any specific constraints or regulations to be considered (privacy concerns, compliance with local laws, data security). Additionally, consider the potential need for a mobile app, provide suggestions if applicable, and outline the minimum viable product (MVP) features. Suggest potential integration points with existing systems or APIs, providing examples where possible. Lastly, recommend a framework for AI models and specify any performance requirements for real-time processing.",
