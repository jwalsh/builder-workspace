    "description": "This RFC aims to revise the project's scope, objectives, and requirements. The focus is on defining consciousness flow (integrating both Global Workspace Theory and Integrated Information Theory), identifying data sources (brain-computer interfaces, EEG devices, self-reported data, potential integration with wearable tech for real-time tracking), outlining visualization needs (interactive dashboards, real-time tracking, statistical analysis tools, options for exporting data for further analysis), defining the target audience (researchers, therapists, educators, neuroscientists, mental health professionals, and patients), addressing ethical considerations (data privacy, informed consent, potential misuse of information, clear communication of data usage policies), discussing potential challenges or limitations (technical feasibility, scalability, interpretability of results, feasibility of real-time processing for large-scale datasets, resource allocation for continuous learning and model improvement), planning the system architecture (architecture patterns such as microservices, event-driven systems, machine learning models for data processing, consider containerization with Docker or Kubernetes, ensure modularity and flexibility for potential future integrations). Upon review, the rfc_state field should be updated to 'READY_FOR_CODE_ARCHITECT' if necessary changes have been suggested.",

Consider incorporating temporal data structures to capture the dynamic nature of consciousness flow over time. Additionally, explore the integration of external data sources, such as brain activity data from wearable devices or social media feeds, to enrich the consciousness flow representation. Define APIs for data ingestion, visualization, and query purposes. To ensure scalability and performance, consider utilizing a combination of NoSQL and SQL databases. Furthermore, incorporate security measures such as data encryption and access controls.",
