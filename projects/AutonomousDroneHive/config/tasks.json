    "title": "Define System Requirements for AutonomousDroneHive: Revised",
    "description": "This RFC aims to investigate and document the functional (use cases) and non-functional requirements (performance criteria, security considerations including FAA regulations, regulatory compliance, integration strategies with existing systems or third-party services, scalability issues, user interface requirements for operators, data visualization needs for analysts, accessibility requirements, and potential security vulnerabilities. The documentation will be clear, concise, easily accessible to all relevant stakeholders. Additionally, a list of mitigation strategies and compliance measures will be provided to ensure regulatory adherence. This task also includes the preparation of a preliminary design document detailing the system architecture, with an emphasis on modularity, scalability, and security. The revised RFC covers the following sections: Functional Requirements, Non-Functional Requirements, Security Considerations (including potential vulnerabilities, mitigation strategies, and compliance measures), Compliance Measures, System Architecture Design, User Interface Requirements for Operators and Data Visualization Needs for Analysts, Accessibility Requirements.",
