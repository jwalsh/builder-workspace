    "description": "Task aims to investigate and document the functional (use cases) and non-functional requirements (performance criteria, security considerations including FAA regulations, regulatory compliance, integration strategies with existing systems or third-party services, scalability issues, user interface requirements for operators, data visualization needs for analysts, and accessibility requirements). The documentation will be clear, concise, easily accessible to all relevant stakeholders. Additionally, a list of potential security vulnerabilities, mitigation strategies, and compliance measures will be provided to ensure regulatory adherence. This task also includes the preparation of a preliminary design document detailing the system architecture, with an emphasis on modularity, scalability, and security. The revised task covers the following sections: Functional Requirements, Non-Functional Requirements, Security Considerations, Compliance Measures, System Architecture Design, and Accessibility Requirements.",
