    "description": "Design the overall system architecture, including the frontend, backend, and data storage components. The architecture should be modular, scalable, and maintainable, with clear separation of concerns. Consider the following components: 1) Frontend: A user-friendly interface for presenting code snippets, accepting user input for documentation, and providing feedback. The frontend should be responsive and accessible, with a clean and intuitive UI/UX design. 2) Backend: Handle user authentication, code snippet management, documentation evaluation, and feedback generation. The backend should be built using a modern, scalable framework or language, with a RESTful API for communication with the frontend. 3) Data Storage: Store code snippets, user submissions, and other relevant data. Consider using a reliable and scalable database solution, such as a relational database or a NoSQL database, depending on the data structure and requirements. 4) Integration with external tools or services (if required), such as code linting tools, documentation generators, or plagiarism checkers. 5) Security considerations for user data and system access, including authentication, authorization, data encryption, and secure communication protocols. 6) Deployment and infrastructure requirements, including containerization, load balancing, and scalability considerations. 7) Logging and monitoring mechanisms for tracking system performance and troubleshooting issues.",
