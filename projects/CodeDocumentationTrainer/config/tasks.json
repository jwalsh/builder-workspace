    "description": "Design the overall system architecture, including the frontend, backend, and data storage components. The architecture should be modular, scalable, and maintainable, with clear separation of concerns. Consider the following components: 1) Frontend: A user-friendly interface for presenting code snippets, accepting user input for documentation, and providing feedback. The frontend should be responsive and accessible, with a clean and intuitive UI/UX design (consider using modern frameworks like React or Angular). 2) Backend: Handle user authentication, code snippet management, documentation evaluation, and feedback generation. The backend should be built using a modern, scalable framework or language (e.g., Node.js, Django, Flask), with a RESTful API for communication with the frontend. 3) Data Storage: Store code snippets, user submissions, and other relevant data. Consider using a reliable and scalable database solution, such as a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) or a NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB), depending on the data structure and requirements. 4) Integration with external tools or services (if required), such as code linting tools (e.g., ESLint, JSHint), documentation generators (e.g., Doxygen, Sphinx), or plagiarism checkers (e.g., Copyscape). 5) Security considerations for user data and system access, including authentication (OAuth2, JSON Web Tokens), authorization, data encryption (AES, RSA), and secure communication protocols (HTTPS, SSL/TLS). 6) Deployment and infrastructure requirements, including containerization (Docker), load balancing, and scalability considerations. 7) Logging and monitoring mechanisms for tracking system performance and troubleshooting issues (e.g., ELK Stack, Prometheus).",

The schema should support efficient querying and retrieval of data for the application's functionality. Use a scalable and performant database system such as MongoDB or PostgreSQL, depending on the data structure and querying requirements. Ensure proper indexing, data integrity constraints, and scalability considerations, with emphasis on handling high write and read throughput due to the interactive nature of the application. For improved maintainability, adhere to best practices for database schema design, such as normalizing the data, using appropriate data types, and defining clear naming conventions. Additionally, consider implementing caching mechanisms or other performance optimizations where necessary. To ensure scalability, consider using a NoSQL database like MongoDB if the data model is flexible and can handle unstructured data well, or PostgreSQL if the data model is more structured and requires complex queries. Once implemented, perform thorough testing to validate the schema's functionality and performance, and make any necessary adjustments before moving to production.",
