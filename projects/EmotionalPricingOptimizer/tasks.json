Ensure scalability, performance, maintainability, ethical considerations are taken into account. Define interfaces and communication protocols between components (FR-PR-BA-DataStorage). Consider edge cases, error handling, and performance optimizations. Incorporate modularity to facilitate future updates or changes. Ensure compliance with relevant data protection regulations (GDPR, CCPA etc.). The design should be flexible enough to accommodate potential future enhancements such as integration with additional emotional detection methods or other AI technologies.",
