    "description": "Review and update the proposed system architecture design for ThoughtPatternObserver. The revised design should include the brain-computer interface, data processing pipeline, visualization components, and supporting infrastructure. Clearly define the system's scalability, performance, security, and data privacy requirements. Consider integration with existing systems, industry standards for brain-computer interfaces, and data exchange formats. Additionally, ensure the design adheres to best practices in the field, addresses potential challenges or limitations such as power consumption, latency, and real-time processing constraints, and follows ethical guidelines related to human subject research. For scalability, the design should also consider future integrations with wearable devices and other IoT components. The updated design should be submitted for review once completed, along with relevant documentation detailing the implementation approach and any relevant trade-offs. If the design requires further refinement or additional resources, update the task accordingly. For the purpose of this RFC, I will focus on the system architecture and provide separate RFCs for other components such as data privacy and ethical guidelines.",
