    "description": "Gather, document, and prioritize the project requirements for an AI system that optimizes energy trading in decentralized energy markets. This includes defining energy trading strategies, identifying market data sources, outlining system constraints, establishing success criteria, and clarifying scope boundaries. Once complete, present the findings to the team for discussion and consensus, highlighting potential risks and benefits of each requirement. Address any interdependencies between requirements. If necessary, propose alternative solutions or approaches. Once all revisions are made, present the revised requirements document to the assigned reviewer for feedback and approval.",
