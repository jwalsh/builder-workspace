    "title": "Revised Project Scope and Requirements: Define for Neural Network Energy Trading System",
    "description": "This RFC aims to gather, document, prioritize, and clarify the project requirements for an AI system that optimizes energy trading in decentralized energy markets. Key aspects include defining trading strategies (including long-short, mean reversion, and machine learning algorithms), identifying market data sources (real-time energy prices, historical data, weather forecasts, etc.), outlining system constraints (e.g., computational power, data storage capacity, real-time processing requirements), establishing success criteria (e.g., profit margin improvement, reduced energy waste), setting scope boundaries (clearly defining what is and isn't included in the project), addressing potential risks and benefits of each requirement, considering alternative solutions or approaches when necessary, and documenting interdependencies between requirements. Upon completion, the findings will be presented to the team for discussion and consensus. If approved, the revised requirements document will be prepared.",
