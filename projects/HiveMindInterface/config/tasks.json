    "description": "This task aims to provide a detailed breakdown of the tasks necessary for this RFC. The focus is on both functional (user stories, API design) and non-functional requirements (performance, security, scalability), use cases, constraints, data models, ethical implications, potential integration with existing systems or technologies, user interface design (wireframes, mockups), accessibility, and user experience aspects. This task will also cover the development of a secure and efficient network for the creation and management of temporary hive minds for enhanced problem-solving and creativity, including peer-to-peer communication protocols, data privacy considerations, and real-time synchronization techniques. The final deliverable should include all necessary documentation (technical specification, user manual) for development, testing, and deployment.",
