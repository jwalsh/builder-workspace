    "description": "Clearly define the scope, objectives, and requirements for the EthicalOracleAI project. This includes specifying the ethical frameworks to be considered (e.g., deontological, consequentialist, virtue ethics), the types of moral dilemmas to be addressed (e.g., bioethics, environmental ethics, social justice, business and technology ethics), the expected functionality (e.g., natural language processing, knowledge base, reasoning engine, machine learning capabilities, user customization options), and the user interface (e.g., web-based, mobile app, conversational AI, potential integration with virtual reality or augmented reality). To ensure a comprehensive review, also consider addressing any potential ethical, legal, and social implications of the system's decisions, and outline strategies for maintaining transparency, accountability, and ensuring user privacy.",
