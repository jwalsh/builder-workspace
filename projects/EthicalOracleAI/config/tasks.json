It should include unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests, ethical scenario tests, and performance tests. Test cases should cover edge cases, error handling, and extreme conditions to ensure robustness. Consider implementing unit tests for individual components of the AI system, stress testing to evaluate the system's performance under heavy loads, and performance benchmarking for a fair comparison with existing systems. Incorporate functional, non-functional, and security testing in the strategy, break down tasks into smaller units for efficient execution, prioritize tests based on their impact on the system's functionality and security. Additionally, include a plan for code reviews during development to ensure code quality and maintainability. Upon completion, conduct a thorough review of the testing strategy to address any potential gaps or oversights. Update this RFC with the final testing strategy once approved.",

Ensure high availability, scalability, and disaster recovery mechanisms are in place. Consider implementing containerization (Docker or Kubernetes) for improved portability and resource management, focusing on microservices architecture to enhance modularity and maintainability. The use of immutable infrastructure is recommended. Emphasize on using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools such as Terraform, CloudFormation, or Azure Resource Manager. Also, ensure implementation of continuous monitoring and logging with solutions like Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack, or AWS CloudWatch. Lastly, consider implementing a CI/CD pipeline using tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or CircleCI, and include automated testing strategies in the pipeline. To ensure security, incorporate security measures such as encryption at rest and in transit, vulnerability scanning, and regular penetration testing. If possible, explore the use of serverless architecture for cost savings and improved scalability. Update the 'assigned_to' field to 'devops-engineer' for further action.",
