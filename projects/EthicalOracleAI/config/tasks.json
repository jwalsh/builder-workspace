Consider implementing containerization (Docker or Kubernetes) for improved portability and resource management, focusing on microservices architecture to enhance modularity and maintainability. The use of immutable infrastructure is recommended. Emphasize on using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools such as Terraform, CloudFormation, or Azure Resource Manager. Also, ensure implementation of continuous monitoring and logging with solutions like Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack, or AWS CloudWatch. Lastly, consider implementing a CI/CD pipeline using tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or CircleCI.",
