Test cases should cover edge cases, error handling, and extreme conditions to ensure robustness. Additionally, consider implementing unit tests for individual components of the AI system, stress testing to evaluate the system's performance under heavy loads, and performance benchmarking for a fair comparison with existing systems. Include functional, non-functional, and security testing in the strategy, and break down the tasks into smaller units for efficient execution.
