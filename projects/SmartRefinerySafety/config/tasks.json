    "description": "Design the overall system architecture considering IoT infrastructure (MQTT for device communication), data pipelines (Kafka or similar), AI models (TensorFlow or PyTorch), and integration with existing systems. The design should take into account scalability, fault tolerance, security, and performance requirements using microservices architecture. Additionally, incorporate best practices in software engineering for maintainability, extensibility, and containerization using Docker. To ensure a robust and secure system, include measures such as data encryption, access controls, and intrusion detection systems. The design should also prioritize real-time data processing capabilities. Lastly, consider the need for monitoring and logging tools like Prometheus or Grafana for troubleshooting and performance analysis.",
