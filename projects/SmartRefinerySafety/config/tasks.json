    "description": "Design the overall system architecture considering IoT infrastructure (MQTT for device communication), data pipelines (Kafka or similar), AI models (TensorFlow or PyTorch), and integration with existing systems. The design should take into account scalability, fault tolerance, security, and performance requirements using microservices architecture. Additionally, incorporate best practices in software engineering for maintainability, extensibility, and containerization using Docker. To ensure a robust and secure system, include measures such as data encryption, access controls, and intrusion detection systems. The design should also prioritize real-time data processing capabilities. For troubleshooting and performance analysis, consider incorporating monitoring and logging tools like Prometheus or Grafana. Lastly, consider the need for a modular approach to allow easy integration of new technologies as they become available.",
