    "description": "Thoroughly document the comprehensive requirements for the self-healing microservices orchestrator. This includes specifying desired features (e.g., automatic service recovery, failure detection, load balancing, intelligent routing), performance goals (detailing response times, throughput, concurrency limits), scalability needs (describing strategies for handling high request volumes with minimal latency and auto-scaling mechanisms), integration points with existing systems, necessary APIs and protocols, any security considerations, and other relevant requirements. Additionally, specify any additional resources required for the successful completion of this task. To ensure clarity, break down the requirements into manageable sections, clearly defining each requirement's purpose and any related constraints.",

The architecture includes key components, their interactions, and the communication protocols. Factors such as scalability, fault tolerance, monitoring, self-healing mechanisms are considered. This document outlines the proposed architecture, the responsibilities of each component, and discusses potential dependencies. The revised version now includes additional considerations for security, resource management, and load balancing. This document is ready for further review and discussion.",

    "description": "Design the mechanisms for detecting failures in microservices, including health checks, monitoring, and logging, and the strategies for automatically recovering from those failures through techniques such as service replication, auto-scaling, and failover, ensuring high availability. Consider potential edge cases and failure scenarios, and ensure the design is scalable and fault-tolerant. Include a detailed analysis of the trade-offs between different recovery strategies, and propose a hybrid approach to maximize system resilience. Also, consider integrating machine learning algorithms for predictive maintenance to further enhance the system's self-healing capabilities. Suggest improvements in monitoring metrics and alerts, emphasizing their role in proactive failure detection and recovery.",

    "description": "Design the monitoring and logging components responsible for: a) health monitoring of microservices, b) capturing relevant events, metrics, and traces for analysis, troubleshooting, and auditing purposes. Consider integrating with existing monitoring solutions (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack) or developing custom components based on project requirements. To ensure scalability and efficiency, consider implementing distributed tracing techniques such as Jaeger or Zipkin. Include guidelines for structured logs (using popular formats like JSON or YAML), alert thresholds, log retention policies, and logging best practices. Additionally, suggest monitoring strategies that can identify root causes of issues quickly. If custom components are necessary, ensure they can be easily integrated with the existing system architecture. Upon completion, conduct a performance analysis to optimize the system for efficient resource usage. Clarify the scope of this task by specifying that the focus is on designing these components, not their implementation, and that an additional task will be created for the actual implementation of these designs. Also, recommend using OpenTelemetry as a unified monitoring and instrumentation framework. Update the dependencies to include 'Design System Architecture' and 'Design Monitoring and Alerting Strategy'.",
