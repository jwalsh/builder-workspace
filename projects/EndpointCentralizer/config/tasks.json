    "description": "Collect, document, prioritize, and clarify requirements for the EndpointCentralizer project. The focus should be on centralizing endpoint access, enabling on-premises to cloud access, addressing security considerations (including edge cases, error handling, and performance optimizations), ensuring scalability, modularity, and adherence to best practices in maintainability. Additionally, consider any other relevant requirements that might arise during this process. Break down the requirements into manageable tasks and create user stories for each task. Collaborate with cross-functional teams (Project Manager, Frontend Developer, Backend Developer, Database Specialist, DevOps Engineer, QA Tester, Security Specialist, Technical Writer) to ensure all aspects are covered.",

The design will also outline assumptions and constraints, future expansion plans, and the potential impact of emerging technologies. Additionally, include sections on disaster recovery strategies, error handling mechanisms, monitoring/logging solutions to ensure system resilience and maintainability, interface designs with frontend and backend developers for seamless integration, and best practices for documentation. Clarify any assumptions made during the design process, and provide a timeline for completion of each stage of the design. This revised RFC is ready for implementation.",
