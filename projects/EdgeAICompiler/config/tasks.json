Supported deep learning frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, ONNX), providing specific versions where applicable \n2. Target edge devices (e.g., Raspberry Pi, NVIDIA Jetson, Google Coral) with details on specific models or versions \n3. Optimization techniques (e.g., quantization, pruning, model compression) providing brief explanations for each technique and mentioning potential additional techniques like knowledge distillation \n4. Performance goals (e.g., inference latency, memory footprint, power consumption) with reasonable and achievable targets for each goal \n5. Security considerations (mention specific standards like TLS 1.2 or OAuth 2.0) and strategies for encryption at rest and in transit \n6. Privacy concerns (discuss anonymization and pseudonymization strategies, data minimization, and differential privacy techniques) \n7. Regulatory compliance (refer to specific regulations like GDPR or CCPA, if applicable) \n8. Usability guidelines for user interaction and interface design \n9. Scalability considerations (discuss how the system should handle increasing model sizes and complexities) \n10. Maintainability strategies (outline strategies for efficient code maintenance and updates, continuous integration/continuous deployment pipelines, and version control) \n\nThe RFC is now ready for the next state. Update the rfc_state field accordingly.",

    "description": "This RFC outlines the design of a modular, extensible, and scalable architecture for the EdgeAICompiler. The proposed design incorporates best practices in compiler design, focusing on parsing and lexing, intermediate representation, optimization passes, code generation, target-specific optimizations for edge devices, error handling, edge cases, and performance optimizations. The task is decomposed into the following manageable subtasks: Parsing, Lexing, Intermediate Representation, Optimization Passes, Code Generation, Error Handling, Target-Specific Optimizations for Edge Devices. For each subtask, clear documentation will be provided, focusing on design decisions, trade-offs, potential risks, and expected timelines. This RFC also includes a detailed plan for testing and validation of the architecture design. Upon completion, this task will be reassigned to the appropriate team member (task-decomposer) for further decomposition. Note that this RFC depends on the definition of project requirements (Task #XXX).",
