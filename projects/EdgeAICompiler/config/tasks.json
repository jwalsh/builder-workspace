    "description": "Design a modular, extensible, and scalable architecture for the EdgeAICompiler. The design should incorporate best practices in compiler design, focusing on parsing and lexing, intermediate representation, optimization passes, code generation, target-specific optimizations for edge devices, error handling, edge cases, and performance optimizations. Break down this task into manageable subtasks (e.g., Parsing, Lexing, Intermediate Representation, Optimization Passes, Code Generation, Error Handling, Target-Specific Optimizations for Edge Devices) and ensure adherence to project requirements and standards. Provide clear documentation for each subtask, focusing on design decisions, trade-offs, potential risks, and expected timelines. Include a detailed plan for testing and validation of the architecture design. Update the task where necessary to reflect these changes. Once the updated task is ready, assign it to the appropriate team member (e.g., task-decomposer).",
