The design should incorporate best practices in compiler design, focusing on parsing and lexing, intermediate representation, optimization passes, code generation, target-specific optimizations for edge devices, error handling, edge cases, and performance optimizations. Break down this task into manageable subtasks (e.g., Parsing, Lexing, Intermediate Representation, Optimization Passes, Code Generation, Error Handling, Target-Specific Optimizations for Edge Devices) and ensure adherence to project requirements and standards. Provide clear documentation for each subtask, focusing on design decisions, trade-offs, and potential risks.",
