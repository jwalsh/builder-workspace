Development of a flexible and scalable simulation engine capable of simulating various terrains, weapons, and scenarios.\n3. Integration with hardware components (VR headsets, motion controllers, etc.) for an engaging user experience.\n4. Networking solutions to enable real-time multiplayer capabilities.\n5. Data management strategies to ensure efficient storage and retrieval of data, while maintaining security and privacy.\n6. Exploration of edge cases, error handling, documentation, accessibility features, and usability improvements for a wide range of users.\n7. Upon completion, prepare a comprehensive technical design document detailing the system architecture, dependencies, and potential roadblocks for further development. In case of any uncertainties or suggestions for further tasks, raise new RFCs.\n\nNote: Consider working closely with the Project Manager and Frontend/Backend Developers to ensure a seamless integration of all components.",
