    "description": "Gather and document the requirements for the CareerMilestoneTracker system. The requirements should include the types of milestones and achievements to be tracked, the reward system, user roles and permissions, data storage and retrieval mechanisms (considering both frontend and backend), user interface design considerations, integration with existing HR systems (API endpoints or webhooks), security and privacy requirements, scalability and performance requirements, long-term maintenance and support requirements, and necessary API endpoints or webhooks. Additionally, consider the following specific aspects: \n1. System functionality for tracking different types of milestones, such as work anniversaries, professional development courses, promotions, etc.\n2. Detailed design of the reward system, including various rewards that can be earned, conditions for earning rewards, and mechanisms for distributing rewards\n3. User roles (employee, manager, HR, admin) and their respective permissions within the system\n4. Data storage and retrieval mechanisms, ensuring compatibility with existing databases and efficient data handling\n5. User interface design considerations, focusing on usability, accessibility, and consistency across different devices and platforms\n6. Integration of the system with existing HR systems for seamless data flow\n7. Security and privacy requirements to protect user data and comply with relevant regulations\n8. Scalability and performance requirements, ensuring the system can handle a large number of users and transactions without compromising speed or reliability.\n9. API endpoints or webhooks necessary for integration with other systems or for third-party applications.\nIf possible, provide wireframes or mockups for the user interface design and security architecture diagrams to help visualize the system's structure.",
