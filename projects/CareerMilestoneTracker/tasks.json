Code Analysis: Perform static code analysis for security vulnerabilities, code style, and best practices, using tools such as SonarQube or Checkmarx.\n5. Package: Create deployable packages or container images.\n6. Deploy to Staging: Deploy the packaged application to a staging environment for further testing.\n7. Acceptance Tests: Run automated acceptance tests against the staging environment, ensuring that all functionalities meet the specified requirements.\n8. Deploy to Production: Deploy the application to the production environment if all tests pass.\n9. Monitoring and Logging: Set up monitoring and logging for both staging and production environments using tools like Splunk or ELK stack. This will help in identifying issues early, improving system performance, and troubleshooting as needed.\n10.
