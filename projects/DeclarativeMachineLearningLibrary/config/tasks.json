    "description": "This task has been reviewed and the following changes have been made:\n- Clarified desired features by specifying a non-functional requirement for the library to support multiple machine learning algorithms.\n- Added a functional requirement for the library to allow users to easily define and train models using a declarative approach.\n- Updated target audience description to include data scientists, researchers, and developers who are interested in machine learning but may not have extensive programming experience.\n- Clarified performance expectations by specifying that the library should be able to efficiently process large datasets with clear guidelines for expected processing time for specific dataset sizes and scenarios.\n- Added scalability requirements by stating that the library should be able to handle increasing amounts of data as needed, with a suggested approach for scaling up or out when necessary.\n- Updated integration requirements to specify that the library should integrate smoothly with popular machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn, as well as common programming languages like Python and R. Additionally, it should provide interoperability with popular data handling libraries such as Pandas and NumPy.\n- Added a requirement for providing extensive documentation to help users understand how to use the library effectively, including tutorials, examples, and API references.\n- Clarified error handling requirements by stating that the library should provide clear and actionable error messages when issues occur during model training or evaluation.\n- Updated the 'assigned_to' field to 'project-manager'.",
