    "description": "This task has been reviewed and the following changes have been made:\\n- Clarified desired features by specifying a non-functional requirement for the library to support multiple machine learning algorithms.\\n- Added a functional requirement for the library to allow users to easily define and train models using a declarative approach.\\n- Updated target audience description to include data scientists, researchers, and developers who are interested in machine learning but may not have extensive programming experience.\\n- Clarified performance expectations by specifying that the library should be able to efficiently process large datasets with clear guidelines for expected processing time for specific dataset sizes and scenarios.\\n- Added scalability requirements by stating that the library should be able to handle increasing amounts of data as needed, with a suggested approach for scaling up or out when necessary.\\n- Updated integration requirements to specify that the library should integrate smoothly with popular machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn, as well as common programming languages like Python and R. Additionally, it should provide interoperability with popular data handling libraries such as Pandas and NumPy.\\n- Added a requirement for providing extensive documentation to help users understand how to use the library effectively, including tutorials, examples, and API references.\\n- Clarified error handling requirements by stating that the library should provide clear and actionable error messages when issues occur during model training or evaluation.\\n- Updated the 'assigned_to' field to 'project-manager', who will oversee the task decomposition and reassignment as needed.\\n- In addition, I suggest adding a requirement for automated testing and validation of the library to ensure its reliability and robustness, and to make it easier to identify and fix any issues that may arise.",
