    "description": "This task has been updated to reflect the current state of the project requirements gathering process. The following changes have been made: \n- Clarified desired features by specifying a non-functional requirement for the library to support multiple machine learning algorithms.\n- Added a functional requirement for the library to allow users to easily define and train models using a declarative approach.\n- Updated target audience description to include data scientists, researchers, and developers who are interested in machine learning but may not have extensive programming experience.\n- Clarified performance expectations by specifying that the library should be able to efficiently process large datasets.\n- Added scalability requirements by stating that the library should be able to handle increasing amounts of data as needed.\n- Updated integration requirements to specify that the library should integrate smoothly with popular machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn.",
