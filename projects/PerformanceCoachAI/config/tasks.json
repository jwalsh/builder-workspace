The database design should take into account potential future growth of the application, security best practices, efficient querying, normalization of data where necessary to ensure data integrity. Include considerations for indexing strategies to optimize query performance, and explore the use of managed database services like AWS RDS or Google Cloud SQL for ease of scaling and high availability. Additionally, consider implementing data replication for improved read-heavy workloads and data backup strategies for disaster recovery purposes. Lastly, perform testing and benchmarking to ensure the chosen database system can handle expected traffic. Furthermore, investigate the use of NoSQL databases like MongoDB or DynamoDB for handling unstructured data such as user feedback or coaching sessions transcripts. Also, consider implementing a caching layer using solutions like Redis or Memcached to reduce the load on the database and improve response times.",
