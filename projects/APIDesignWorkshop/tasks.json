    "description": "This task aims to gather and document the detailed requirements for the APIDesignWorkshop platform. The focus will be on maintainability, modularity, scalability, considering edge cases, error handling, and performance optimizations. Comprehensive stakeholder interviews, market research, and competitive analysis will be conducted to ensure a thorough understanding of the project's goals and objectives. Key stakeholders such as developers, API consumers, and business stakeholders will be identified, and their input gathered. The project scope will be defined, including the target industries or domains, types of APIs (e.g., REST, GraphQL, WebSockets), and desired features and functionalities (API design tools, documentation generators, testing frameworks, deployment options). The platform's architecture, emphasizing front-end, back-end, and database components, potential integration points with existing systems or third-party services will be clarified. The project's success criteria and key performance indicators (KPIs), considering factors like usability, reliability, and scalability will be established. The desired performance benchmarks, error handling strategies, and edge case handling methods will also be defined. The documentation will be updated to reflect these changes. This task has been broken down into subtasks: 1) Stakeholder Interviews and Market Research, 2) Competitive Analysis and SWOT Analysis, 3) Detailed Feature Analysis and Architecture Design, 4) Documentation Updates. Each of the subtasks will be assigned to a team member with appropriate expertise.",
