    "description": "This task aims to gather and document the detailed requirements for the APIDesignWorkshop platform. The focus will be on maintainability, modularity, scalability, considering edge cases, error handling, and performance optimizations. Comprehensive stakeholder interviews, market research, and competitive analysis will be conducted to ensure a thorough understanding of the project's goals and objectives. Key stakeholders such as developers, API consumers, and business stakeholders will be identified, and their input gathered. The project scope will be defined, including the target industries or domains, types of APIs (e.g., REST, GraphQL, WebSockets), and desired features and functionalities (API design tools, documentation generators, testing frameworks, deployment options). The platform's architecture, emphasizing front-end, back-end, and database components, potential integration points with existing systems or third-party services will be clarified. The project's success criteria and key performance indicators (KPIs), considering factors like usability, reliability, and scalability will be established. The desired performance benchmarks, error handling strategies, and edge case handling methods will also be defined. The documentation will be updated to reflect these changes. This task has been broken down into subtasks: 1) Stakeholder Interviews and Market Research, 2) Competitive Analysis and SWOT Analysis, 3) Detailed Feature Analysis and Architecture Design, 4) Documentation Updates, 5) User Experience (UX) Design. Each of the subtasks will be assigned to a team member with appropriate expertise. **It is recommended to add a subtask for user testing during the development phase to ensure the platform's interfaces are intuitive and user-friendly.** The rfc_state field should be updated to 'APPROVAL'.",

    "description": "Design the overall system architecture, including the frontend, backend, database, and any necessary integrations or third-party services. The revised architecture prioritizes maintainability, modularity, scalability, and addresses edge cases, error handling, and performance optimizations effectively. Ensure separation of concerns, loose coupling, and high cohesion among components. Identify potential bottlenecks and propose strategies for load balancing, caching, and horizontal scaling with a focus on ensuring optimal user experience. Define the communication protocols and data formats for inter-component communication, prioritizing security and efficiency. Outline the deployment strategy, including containerization, orchestration, and infrastructure provisioning considering cost-effectiveness and ease of maintenance. Provide detailed documentation and diagrams to facilitate understanding and collaboration among team members, with a focus on clarity and conciseness. (Please review the design for potential refinements as needed.) Ensure that the architecture adheres to best practices such as 12-factor app methodology and follows RESTful principles where applicable. Also, consider the implementation of monitoring and logging tools to aid in debugging and error handling. In addition, suggest a strategy for continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipeline, since it is crucial for efficient development and deployment of the platform. Finally, highlight any areas where further research or exploration might be required before finalizing the design.",
