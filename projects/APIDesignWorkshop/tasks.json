    "description": "Gather and document the detailed requirements for the APIDesignWorkshop platform, focusing on maintainability, modularity, scalability, and considering edge cases, error handling, and performance optimizations. Conduct comprehensive stakeholder interviews, market research, and competitive analysis to ensure a thorough understanding of the project's goals and objectives. Identify key stakeholders such as developers, API consumers, and business stakeholders, and gather their input. Define the project scope, including the target industries or domains, types of APIs (e.g., REST, GraphQL, WebSockets), and desired features and functionalities (API design tools, documentation generators, testing frameworks, deployment options). Clarify the platform's architecture, emphasizing front-end, back-end, and database components, potential integration points with existing systems or third-party services. Establish the project's success criteria and key performance indicators (KPIs), considering factors like usability, reliability, and scalability. Define the desired performance benchmarks, error handling strategies, and edge case handling methods. Update the documentation to reflect these changes. For optimal review, break down this task into subtasks: 1) Stakeholder Interviews and Market Research, 2) Competitive Analysis and SWOT Analysis, 3) Detailed Feature Analysis and Architecture Design, 4) Documentation Updates. Assign each of the subtasks to a team member with appropriate expertise.",
