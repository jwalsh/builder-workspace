The architecture should consider scalability, maintainability, performance requirements, security, compliance with relevant regulations (e.g., data privacy, ethical AI guidelines), edge cases, error handling, and performance optimizations. The design should be modular and follow best practices in software development. Ensure that the design is ready for future expansions and can handle increased complexity as new features are added.",
