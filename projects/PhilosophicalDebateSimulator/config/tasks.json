    "description": "Clearly outline the project's scope, objectives, and technical requirements. The philosophical knowledge bases will include comprehensive data on historical philosophers, their beliefs, and key arguments. Contemporary issues for debate will be sourced from current events, popular culture, and societal challenges. The desired user experience includes a seamless interface for easy navigation, real-time debate simulations, and options to customize the philosopher participants and debate topics. Technologies or frameworks to be used include Python for backend development, ReactJS for frontend, Django REST Framework for API design, PostgreSQL for the database, and Flask-Security for security considerations.",
