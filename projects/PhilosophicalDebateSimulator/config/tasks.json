    "title": "Define Project Scope and Requirements (Revised)",
    "description": "This RFC outlines the revised scope, objectives, and technical requirements for the PhilosophicalDebateSimulator project. The platform will simulate debates between historical philosophers on contemporary issues using natural language processing and vast philosophical knowledge bases. The philosophical knowledge bases will include comprehensive data on historical philosophers, their beliefs, and key arguments. Contemporary issues for debate will be sourced from current events, popular culture, and societal challenges. The desired user experience includes a seamless interface for easy navigation, real-time debate simulations, and options to customize the philosopher participants and debate topics. Technologies or frameworks to be used include Python for backend development, ReactJS for frontend, Django REST Framework for API design, PostgreSQL for the database, and Flask-Security for security considerations.\n\n**Proposed Changes:**\n1. Clarify that the AI component will generate responses for the philosophers in the debate, based on their known beliefs and arguments.\n2. Incorporate user feedback mechanism to improve the quality of generated responses and adjust the difficulty level of debates.\n3. Consider implementing a chat-bot feature for initial interaction with users before starting a debate.\n4. Plan for multi-language support to cater to a global audience.\n\n**Notes:**\n1. The proposed changes might require additional resources or modifications to the current timeline. These aspects should be discussed further with the project manager and team.\n2. Once this RFC is approved, it will be passed on to the task-decomposer for further decomposition into individual tasks.",
