This includes: specifying the types of ergonomic recommendations to be provided, outlining user interface design principles and functionality, identifying data sources for ergonomic guidelines and best practices, determining target platforms (web, mobile, etc.), considering any specific constraints or regulations, and establishing accessibility standards. Additionally, provide a detailed system architecture design, including frontend, backend, and database components, along with any necessary APIs and integrations. Clearly define the data model and interaction between different system components. Specify security measures to protect user data. Lastly, establish a plan for testing and validation of the system.",
