    "description": "Design the overall system architecture, including the components, data flow, integration points, and key considerations such as scalability, maintainability, security, and performance. The architecture should include the following components: a web application (frontend), a backend API, a database, a recommendation engine, a content management system, and a notification system. Consider the integration with existing learning management systems (LMS) or content providers. Address data privacy and security concerns, as well as scalability requirements for handling a large number of users and content. Also, outline strategies to ensure the system's accessibility and compatibility across various devices and platforms, emphasizing on progressively enhanced web applications for cross-browser compatibility. Discuss the use of microservices architecture for better modularity and scalability. Lastly, detail how the system will be designed to comply with relevant accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1) and performance best practices.",
