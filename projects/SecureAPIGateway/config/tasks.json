    "description": "Draft a comprehensive document outlining the detailed requirements for the SecureAPIGateway project. This should include security features such as AI-powered threat detection, automated response mechanisms, integration with existing systems (e.g., WAF, IDS, SIEM), performance expectations (include SLAs), scalability considerations, and any necessary user interface design specifications. The document will also outline the threat types to be detected (e.g., DDoS attacks, SQL injection, XSS) and the automated responses for each (e.g., rate limiting, firewall rules, content filtering), including performance impact of these actions. It is recommended to consider potential false positives and negatives in the AI threat detection system. In addition, provide a high-level architecture diagram that visualizes the flow of data and the interaction between different components, detailing the integration points with existing systems. Furthermore, clarify the need for real-time logging and monitoring capabilities, and suggest the necessary metrics to track the performance and effectiveness of the AI threat detection system. Lastly, consider potential edge cases and provide solutions for them.",
