The target microservices architecture should be specified, along with desired visualization formats (e.g., diagrams, reports), input data sources (logs, configuration files), analysis techniques (static or dynamic), output formats, user interface requirements, security considerations, performance requirements, specific features or constraints, and any additional tools or libraries that may be necessary. The target audience for this tool should also be identified. This task is currently in TODO status and has been assigned to the project manager with a priority of 5.",
