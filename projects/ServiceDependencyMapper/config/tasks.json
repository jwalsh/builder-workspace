    "description": "This RFC outlines the requirements for the ServiceDependencyMapper tool. The target microservices architecture should be explicitly defined (e.g., Kubernetes, AWS Lambda). Desired visualization formats (diagrams, reports) are specified along with input data sources (logs, configuration files), analysis techniques (static or dynamic), output formats, user interface requirements (responsive design, interactive features including filtering and zooming options), security considerations (data privacy, authentication/authorization), performance requirements (response time, scalability), specific features or constraints (real-time dependency mapping, compatibility with various microservices frameworks), and any additional tools or libraries that may be necessary. The target audience for this tool should also be identified and categorized (developers, DevOps engineers, system architects). This task is currently in REVIEW status and has been reassigned to the project manager with a priority of 5. The following suggested changes have been made: 1. Clarify the target microservices architecture. 2. Add interactive UI features to the user interface requirements. 3. Incorporate data privacy and authentication/authorization security considerations. 4. Specify performance requirements in terms of response time and scalability. 5. Consider adding a feature for dependency impact analysis (highlighting the effects of removing or modifying a service on the overall architecture). If this RFC is approved, it will be moved to the IMPLEMENTATION state.",
