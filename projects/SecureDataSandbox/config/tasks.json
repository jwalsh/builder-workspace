    "description": "Gather and document detailed project requirements for SecureDataSandbox. This includes, but is not limited to: security considerations such as threat modeling and security controls, performance goals including response times, scalability needs, integration with existing systems including APIs and data formats, potential data handling restrictions due to privacy or regulatory concerns, a roadmap for phased deployment and iterative improvements that prioritize quick wins and addresses long-term vision. Additionally, the task will include creating use cases and user stories to provide a more comprehensive understanding of project requirements, with an emphasis on clarity and conciseness for easy comprehension by all stakeholders. This revised draft is now ready for review.",

    "description": "Design the overall architecture of the secure data sandbox, including components, communication protocols (e.g., gRPC or another secure RESTful API for internal and external communications), security mechanisms (such as encryption using AES-256-GCM, access control, and authentication), data flow, isolation strategies (e.g., virtualization or containerization technologies like Docker). Optimize for scalability, high availability, and fault tolerance. Define monitoring and logging mechanisms for security auditing, incident response, and performance tuning. Ensure secure file transfer protocols are used for both internal and external data transfers, considering SFTP or similar standards. For added protection against DDoS attacks, implement rate limiting and load balancing. Document the architecture design in the project's technical documentation, detailing each component's responsibilities, data flow diagrams, and security controls. Include a discussion of the chosen technologies' strengths and potential vulnerabilities. Discuss strategies for ensuring the system remains up-to-date with security patches and best practices. Update the project scope and requirements document based on this architecture design.",
