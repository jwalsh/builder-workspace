    "description": "This RFC aims to gather and document detailed project requirements for SecureDataSandbox. The scope includes: security considerations such as threat modeling, security controls, performance goals including response times, scalability needs, integration with existing systems including APIs and data formats, potential data handling restrictions due to privacy or regulatory concerns, a roadmap for phased deployment and iterative improvements that prioritize quick wins and addresses long-term vision. The task will also create use cases and user stories for a comprehensive understanding of project requirements, emphasizing clarity and conciseness. This revised draft is now ready for review from the assigned code-architect.",

    "title": "Design System Architecture for SecureDataSandbox",
    "description": "Design the overall architecture of the secure data sandbox, including components, communication protocols (e.g., gRPC or another secure RESTful API for internal and external communications), security mechanisms (such as encryption using AES-256-GCM, access control, and authentication), data flow, isolation strategies (e.g., virtualization or containerization technologies like Docker). Optimize for scalability, high availability, and fault tolerance. Define monitoring and logging mechanisms for security auditing, incident response, and performance tuning. Ensure secure file transfer protocols are used for both internal and external data transfers, considering SFTP or similar standards. Implement rate limiting and load balancing to protect against DDoS attacks. For added protection, consider implementing TLS/SSL certificates and two-factor authentication. Document the architecture design in the project's technical documentation, detailing each component's responsibilities, data flow diagrams, and security controls. Include a discussion of the chosen technologies' strengths and potential vulnerabilities. Discuss strategies for ensuring the system remains up-to-date with security patches and best practices. Update the project scope and requirements document based on this architecture design. Suggest using Kubernetes for container orchestration, as it offers robustness in managing containers and their resources.",
