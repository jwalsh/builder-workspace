Consider optimizing for scalability, high availability, and fault tolerance. Define monitoring and logging mechanisms for security auditing, incident response, and performance tuning. Ensure secure file transfer protocols are used for both internal and external data transfers. For internal communication within the sandbox, consider gRPC or another secure RESTful API. Document the architecture design in the project's technical documentation.",
