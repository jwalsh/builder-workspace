    "description": "Revised and expanded detailed requirements for the LiveDocumentationUpdater system. The requirements include types of documentation to be updated (e.g., user guides, API docs, code comments, technical blogs), sources of code and process changes (including version control systems such as GitHub or Bitbucket, continuous integration/continuous deployment pipelines like Jenkins or CircleCI, event-driven triggers such as webhooks or events from messaging queues), desired update mechanisms (real-time, scheduled, on-demand), handling of edge cases such as merges, pull requests, hotfixes, support for multiple programming languages, and consideration for compatibility with various IDEs. This aim is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the system's intended functionality, its interactions with other components, and how it will adapt to our ever-evolving development landscape. Additionally, it would be beneficial to consider integrating the system with popular issue tracking tools like Jira or GitHub Issues for better traceability.",
