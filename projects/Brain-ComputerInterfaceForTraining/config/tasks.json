    "description": "Detailed requirements gathering for the Brain-Computer Interface for Training platform is initiated. The focus will be on identifying target users (students, professionals, researchers), learning objectives (accelerated skill acquisition, memory enhancement, cognitive training), desired features (personalized learning paths, progress tracking, gamification, data visualization, real-time user feedback, adaptive learning algorithms), performance expectations (responsiveness, scalability, security with a focus on data privacy and GDPR compliance), any hardware requirements (compatible EEG devices, VR equipment if applicable), and constraints or considerations related to regulatory requirements, accessibility, and integration with existing platforms. The findings will be documented for further development. It would also be beneficial to establish a clear roadmap for the project's phases and milestones.",
