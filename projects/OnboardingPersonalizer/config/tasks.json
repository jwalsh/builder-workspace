    "description": "This RFC proposes the design of a comprehensive system architecture for the AI-driven Onboarding Personalization System, encompassing frontend and backend components, data flow, integration points, and key considerations such as scalability, maintainability, performance, modularity, extensibility, and reusability. The design focuses on future flexibility by choosing appropriate AI libraries, discussing their potential impact on system performance, and outlining the necessary modules for role-based personalization, adaptive learning, and seamless user interface integration. The chosen architecture will ensure a scalable, efficient, and robust solution for creating personalized onboarding experiences based on employees' roles, backgrounds, and learning styles.",
