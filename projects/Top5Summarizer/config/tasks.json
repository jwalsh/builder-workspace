    "description": "This updated RFC expands on the detailed requirements for the Top5Summarizer tool. The following aspects are addressed: input formats (various document, report, and discussion types), output formats (structured text, bullet points, or summary paragraphs), performance expectations (summarize a document in less than 30 seconds with 95% accuracy), specific constraints or limitations (no sensitive information extraction, limited to English language for initial version, and ability to handle other languages at a later stage), user interface requirements (simple input field, 'Generate Summary' button, and output text area), security and privacy considerations (comply with GDPR, protect user data, no sharing of summarized content without explicit consent, and implement secure data storage and transfer methods), deployment and scaling requirements (cloud-based solution, able to handle large volumes of requests, and provide scalability options such as auto-scaling groups and load balancing), integration with popular document management systems, usability testing considerations (conduct user testing sessions to ensure the tool is intuitive and effective), technical aspects on data storage (use secure, encrypted databases for storage), API endpoints (create RESTful API endpoints for easy integration), and other improvements. This RFC is now ready for review by the assigned task-decomposer or project-manager. If necessary, additional fields can be added for specific details.",
