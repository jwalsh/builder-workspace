    "description": "This RFC outlines the creation of a comprehensive document detailing the requirements for the InclusivityAnalyzer tool. The document will include target user personas, use cases, desired features, data sources (internal and external such as company communications platforms, HR systems, and public data), API and service integration points (Slack, Google Workspace, etc.), security and privacy considerations (including GDPR and HIPAA compliance if applicable), performance and scalability requirements, accessibility, usability, cultural sensitivity, and a roadmap for implementing these requirements in phases. The document will also address design principles such as inclusivity, ethics, and user-centricity throughout the tool's lifecycle, with a focus on transparency and explainability of AI models used. It will outline the process for regular updates and reviews to ensure ongoing compliance and relevance. Additionally, this RFC emphasizes the importance of diversity in the development team, encouraging input from various backgrounds and experiences. Upon completion, this RFC will be reviewed by the project manager and other stakeholders for approval before moving forward to the next phase. The document should further outline the process for incorporating feedback from diverse perspectives during the development process. The assigned task is now with the 'task-decomposer'.",

Ensure the design is inclusive, follows best practices for diversity, accessibility, scalability, performance, security, and maintainability. Utilize microservices architecture to improve scalability and modularity. Detailed design should include: 1) Frontend interface for input and display of data, 2) Backend services for processing and analysis, 3) Database structure for storage, and 4) APIs for integration with other systems. Also, prioritize accessibility and usability in the design process.",

This includes structuring the data for efficient querying and analysis while considering factors such as privacy, scalability, adaptability to different types of company structures, and tracking changes over time. The design incorporates version control mechanisms and is optimized for data integrity. Additionally, the model's flexibility allows it to be expanded with new features or modifications as necessary. To ensure clarity and maintainability, consider adding documentation outlining the structure, purpose, and relationships of each element in the data model.",
