    "description": "Create a comprehensive document detailing the requirements for the InclusivityAnalyzer tool. This should include target user personas (both employees and managers), use cases, desired features, data sources (internal and external such as company communications platforms, HR systems, and public data), API and service integration points (Slack, Google Workspace, etc.), security and privacy considerations (including GDPR and HIPAA compliance if applicable), performance and scalability requirements, accessibility, usability, cultural sensitivity, and a roadmap for implementing these requirements in phases. The document should also address design principles such as inclusivity, ethics, and user-centricity throughout the tool's lifecycle, with a focus on transparency and explainability of AI models used. The document should further outline the process for regular updates and reviews to ensure ongoing compliance and relevance. Upon completion, this RFC will be reviewed by the project manager and other stakeholders for approval before moving forward to the next phase.",
