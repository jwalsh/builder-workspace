    "title": "Define System Architecture",
    "description": "Design the overall system architecture, incorporating scalability, fault tolerance, security, real-time data processing, and integration with third-party services (e.g., mapping, traffic data, payment gateways). The architecture should follow a microservices approach, with separate services for fleet management, routing, dispatching, and customer-facing interfaces. Ensure that the architecture supports horizontal scaling, load balancing, and failover mechanisms. Incorporate event-driven architectures and message queues for asynchronous communication between services. Implement secure communication protocols and data encryption for sensitive information. Utilize containerization and orchestration tools for deployment and management, emphasizing on using Kubernetes for orchestration. To improve the maintainability of the system, consider implementing a service mesh like Istio or Linkerd. Also, ensure that the architecture is compatible with serverless functions if necessary. Lastly, document the architecture design in a clear and concise manner for future reference.",
