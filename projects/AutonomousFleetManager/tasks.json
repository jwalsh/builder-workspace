    "description": "Design the overall system architecture, including components, interfaces, and data flow. Consider the following aspects: scalability, fault tolerance, security, real-time data processing, and integration with third-party services (e.g., mapping, traffic data, payment gateways). The architecture should follow a microservices approach, with separate services for fleet management, routing, dispatching, and customer-facing interfaces. Ensure that the architecture supports horizontal scaling, load balancing, and failover mechanisms. Incorporate event-driven architectures and message queues for asynchronous communication between services. Implement secure communication protocols and data encryption for sensitive information. Utilize containerization and orchestration tools for deployment and management.",
