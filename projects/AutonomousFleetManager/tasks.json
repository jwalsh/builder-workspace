    "description": "Design the overall system architecture for Autonomous Fleet Manager. The architecture should incorporate scalability, fault tolerance, security, real-time data processing, and integration with third-party services such as mapping, traffic data, payment gateways, etc. The design will follow a microservices approach, with separate services for fleet management, routing, dispatching, and customer-facing interfaces. To ensure scalability, consider implementing horizontal scaling, load balancing, and failover mechanisms. For efficient communication between these microservices, employ event-driven architectures and message queues. Implement secure communication protocols and data encryption for sensitive information, using containerization and orchestration tools like Kubernetes for deployment and management. Consider utilizing a service mesh such as Istio or Linkerd to improve maintainability. To support serverless functions if necessary, ensure the architecture is compatible with them. Document the design clearly and concisely for future reference. As the Code Architect, I recommend revisiting the necessity of implementing serverless functions, given the current state-of-the-art in autonomous vehicle fleet management.",
