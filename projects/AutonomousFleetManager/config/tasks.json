    "title": "Define System Architecture for Autonomous Fleet Manager (Revised)",
    "description": "This revised design outlines the overall system architecture for Autonomous Fleet Manager. The architecture will incorporate scalability, fault tolerance, security, real-time data processing, and integration with third-party services such as mapping, traffic data, payment gateways, etc. To ensure scalability, consider implementing horizontal scaling, load balancing, and failover mechanisms. For efficient communication between microservices, employ event-driven architectures and message queues. Implement secure communication protocols and data encryption for sensitive information using containerization (e.g., Docker) and orchestration tools like Kubernetes for deployment and management. Consider utilizing a service mesh such as Istio or Linkerd to improve maintainability. To support serverless functions if necessary, ensure the architecture is compatible with them; however, given the current state-of-the-art in autonomous vehicle fleet management, it may be more beneficial to focus on serverful solutions for improved performance and control. Document the design clearly and concisely for future reference. Incorporating AI/ML integration for optimizing fleet operations and management is highly recommended, with potential use cases including route optimization, predictive maintenance, and dynamic pricing strategies. Update the architecture design to include these points and provide a detailed explanation of how they will be implemented. This revised RFC also suggests updating the 'assigned_to' field to 'project-manager' for further task decomposition and assignment. Finally, I recommend revisiting the necessity of implementing serverless functions based on the evolving needs and advancements in the field, and assessing potential benefits before making a final decision.",
