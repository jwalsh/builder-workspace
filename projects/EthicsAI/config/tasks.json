This includes but is not limited to: encryption of sensitive data, secure authentication and authorization mechanisms, input validation and sanitization, secure communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS), regular security audits and vulnerability assessments according to industry best practices (OWASP, NIST), adherence to current and emerging security standards, a defense-in-depth approach considering threats at various levels of the system stack, regular penetration testing, incident response planning, secure coding practices, and regular security training for team members. It is also recommended to include a focus on threat modeling, multi-factor authentication, log management and monitoring, and the use of reputable security libraries and frameworks where applicable. Once the initial implementation is complete, conduct a thorough review and update the task with specific implementations for each suggested measure. Upon completion, submit a separate RFC for documentation and knowledge sharing within the team. If needed, collaborate with relevant experts (e.g., security-specialist) during the implementation process. Update the rfc_state field to 'NEEDS_WORK' when additional details are required or to 'DONE' when the task is completed.",
