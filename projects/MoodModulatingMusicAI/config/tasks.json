    "title": "Define Project Scope and Requirements - Revised",
    "description": "Revise the project requirements document to include a comprehensive list of desired emotional states or cognitive enhancements (e.g., happiness, calmness, focus, creativity), target audience (specific age groups, musical preferences), specific constraints or guidelines (e.g., data privacy regulations, musical style limitations), and define the scope of the project, including expected features (e.g., real-time user feedback, AI composition customization), functionalities, and deliverables. The revised document should also outline the approach for creating real-time AI compositions, with emphasis on ethical considerations such as fairness, accountability, transparency, and privacy. Include a section on data collection, storage, and usage policies. Mention the potential use of machine learning models and their training data, ensuring diversity and inclusivity in the training dataset. Suggest improvements to the project design if necessary. Update the document with examples or case studies that demonstrate the effectiveness of similar AI-generated music systems. Once completed, provide a detailed plan for implementation, testing, and deployment. Additionally, clarify the methodology for measuring the emotional impact of the generated music on users and the process for gathering user feedback. Lastly, consider the long-term scalability of the project and propose strategies to maintain and improve the AI model's performance over time. Once completed, update the document with these additional details and provide a detailed plan for implementation, testing, and deployment.",
