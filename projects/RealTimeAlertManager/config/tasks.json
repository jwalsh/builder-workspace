    "description": "Define the project scope, objectives, and requirements for the RealTimeAlertManager system. This includes gathering input from stakeholders, understanding business needs, defining the system architecture with a focus on scalability, performance, and maintainability, identifying integrations with existing systems, detailing functional and non-functional requirements, creating a comprehensive use case document, outlining potential edge cases, and documenting these findings in a clear and concise manner. Additionally, consider the impact of potential future enhancements or changes to the system and how they could be accommodated in the initial design. Lastly, ensure that the designed system is secure, adheres to best practices, and is accessible to all users. If necessary, suggest any additional steps or areas of focus during this planning phase. To further improve the RFC, consider adding the following sub-tasks: 1. Researching and understanding the current state of the art in alert management systems. 2. Defining key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure the success of the system. 3. Identifying potential risks and mitigation strategies during the development process. 4. Creating a project timeline with milestones and deadlines for each phase of the project. Update the 'assigned_to' field to 'project-manager', as this task requires coordination among various stakeholders. The RFC is ready for the next state, so update the 'rfc_state' field to 'IN_PROGRESS'.",
