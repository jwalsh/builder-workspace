Include a section on performance optimization strategies such as caching, compression, and multithreading. Provide a rough timeline and resource requirements for each stage of the project. Update the task assignment to include software architect, hardware engineer, and system integrator, in addition to the frontend-developer, backend-developer, and task-decomposer. Assign to the code-architect for further refinement before review.",
