    "description": "Update the description to include specific details about the hardware components (e.g., haptic gloves, vests, or controllers), software modules (e.g., haptic algorithms, driver software, and user interface), data flow diagrams, integration strategies with popular VR environments such as Unity, Unreal Engine, Oculus, SteamVR, communication protocols (e.g., Bluetooth, USB, WiFi, HID), scalability plans for multi-user scenarios including load balancing and concurrency control, compatibility considerations (e.g., device compatibility across popular brands, OS support including Windows, Linux, macOS, and mobile platforms), provide a high-level overview of the proposed modular architecture (decoupling hardware drivers, algorithms, and user interface for easier maintenance and scalability), data storage solutions (centralized vs decentralized, database design considerations), security measures (encryption methods, access controls, and secure communication channels), robustness strategies (error handling, system recovery, and fault tolerance), performance optimization strategies such as caching, compression, and multithreading, and a rough timeline and resource requirements for each stage of the project. Update the task assignment to include software architect, hardware engineer, system integrator, frontend-developer, backend-developer, task-decomposer. Assign to the code-architect for further refinement before review. Add a section on potential challenges and risks associated with the project and propose mitigation strategies. Include a brief literature review of relevant studies or research in the field of haptic feedback systems in VR environments. Provide a section on user testing plans and expectations. Update the task dependencies to include 'Gather Requirements', 'Research Existing Solutions', 'Performance Optimization Research', 'Literature Review' and 'User Testing Plan'. Include 'Project-Manager' as the next assignee after 'code-architect' for project coordination.",
