    "description": "Gather and document the project's scope, objectives, and functional and non-functional requirements, including user stories, technical specifications, and constraints. Ensure to consider the following aspects:\n\n1. User Experience: Define the target audience, their needs, and desired user experience for the platform. Conduct user research and create personas to guide design decisions.\n2. Historical and Future Scenarios: Identify the initial set of historical periods and future scenarios to be simulated, and the criteria for selecting and adding new ones. Establish a process for community input and voting on new content additions.\n3. Educational and Entertainment Elements: Determine the balance between educational and entertainment aspects, and how they will be integrated. Consider gamification strategies to increase engagement and learning.\n4. Simulation Fidelity: Establish the desired level of realism and accuracy for the simulations. Define a grading system for simulation quality based on research and historical accuracy.\n5. Scalability and Performance: Consider the expected user load and define scalability and performance requirements. Identify potential bottlenecks and plan for future growth.\n6. Security and Privacy: Identify potential security and privacy concerns, and define measures to address them. Implement encryption, secure authentication, and data protection practices.\n7. Monetization and Business Model: Explore potential revenue streams such as subscription models, in-app purchases, advertising, and partnerships. Define a sustainable business model that aligns with user needs and market trends.\n8. Compliance and Legal: Identify any relevant legal and regulatory requirements. Consult with legal experts to ensure compliance with data protection laws, intellectual property rights, and historical accuracy.\n9. Documentation: Ensure that all development processes are well-documented for future reference and knowledge transfer.",
