    "title": "Define Project Scope and Requirements - Revised",
    "description": "Gather and document the project's scope, objectives, and functional and non-functional requirements, including user stories, technical specifications, and constraints. Ensure to consider the following aspects:\n\n1. User Experience: Define the target audience, their needs, and desired user experience for the platform. Conduct user research and create personas to guide design decisions.\n2. Historical and Future Scenarios: Identify the initial set of historical periods and future scenarios to be simulated, and the criteria for selecting and adding new ones. Establish a process for community input and voting on new content additions, considering the potential impact on server load and performance.\n3. Educational and Entertainment Elements: Determine the balance between educational and entertainment aspects, and how they will be integrated. Consider gamification strategies to increase engagement and learning. Additionally, provide examples of specific features that would support both educational and entertaining experiences. Emphasize the importance of creating a seamless transition between educational content and entertainment elements.\n4. Simulation Fidelity: Establish the desired level of realism and accuracy for the simulations. Define a grading system for simulation quality based on research and historical accuracy. Include details about how this grading system will be implemented and verified, and consider involving subject matter experts in its development.\n5. Scalability and Performance: Consider the expected user load and define scalability and performance requirements. Identify potential bottlenecks and plan for future growth by implementing strategies such as caching, load balancing, and horizontal scaling. Provide examples of strategies to ensure optimal performance under high-load conditions.\n6. Security and Privacy: Identify potential security and privacy concerns, and define measures to address them. Implement encryption, secure authentication, and data protection practices. Discuss the specific technologies or solutions that will be used in this regard, and consider conducting regular security audits and penetration testing.\n7. Monetization and Business Model: Explore potential revenue streams such as subscription models, in-app purchases, advertising, and partnerships. Define a sustainable business model that aligns with user needs and market trends. Consider different pricing strategies and their effects on user acquisition and retention, while ensuring a balance between generating revenue and maintaining a positive user experience.\n8. Compliance and Legal: Identify any relevant legal and regulatory requirements. Consult with legal experts to ensure compliance with data protection laws, intellectual property rights, and historical accuracy. Provide details about any necessary licenses or agreements that need to be in place, and consider establishing a legal team or consultant for ongoing advice.\n9. Documentation: Ensure that all development processes are well-documented for future reference and knowledge transfer. Discuss the tools and methodologies that will be used for documentation, such as wiki pages, design documents, and code comments, and emphasize the importance of clear and concise documentation.\n10. Timeline and Milestones: Estimate the time required to complete each task, and set milestones for key deliverables. Consider breaking down larger tasks into smaller, more manageable subtasks where appropriate.\n\nPlease note that I have made a few minor adjustments for clarity, but overall, this RFC is well-structured and comprehensive.",

    "description": "Design the overall system architecture, including components, modules, and their interactions. The design should consider scalability, performance, security, data management, simulation engine, user interface, integration with external services (e.g., payment gateways, historical data sources), and adhere to the project's scope and requirements. Furthermore, ensure the system architecture is modular, extensible, and maintainable. The design should also cover the following aspects: 1. Microservices architecture for scalability and fault tolerance, 2. Use of containerization technologies like Docker and Kubernetes for deployment and orchestration, 3. Database solutions (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) for data storage and management, 4. Implementing an event-driven architecture for efficient communication between components, 5. Load balancing mechanisms to handle high traffic, 6. Security measures such as encryption, authentication, and authorization, 7. Monitoring and logging infrastructure for troubleshooting and performance optimization, 8. Document the design in a clear and concise manner, and 9. Include considerations for disaster recovery and data backup strategies. The design should be ready for further task decomposition once approved.",
