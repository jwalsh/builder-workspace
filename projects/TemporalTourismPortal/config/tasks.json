    "title": "Define Project Scope and Requirements - Revised",
    "description": "Gather and document the project's scope, objectives, and functional and non-functional requirements, including user stories, technical specifications, and constraints. Ensure to consider the following aspects:\n\n1. User Experience: Define the target audience, their needs, and desired user experience for the platform. Conduct user research and create personas to guide design decisions.\n2. Historical and Future Scenarios: Identify the initial set of historical periods and future scenarios to be simulated, and the criteria for selecting and adding new ones. Establish a process for community input and voting on new content additions.\n3. Educational and Entertainment Elements: Determine the balance between educational and entertainment aspects, and how they will be integrated. Consider gamification strategies to increase engagement and learning. Additionally, provide examples of specific features that would support both educational and entertaining experiences.\n4. Simulation Fidelity: Establish the desired level of realism and accuracy for the simulations. Define a grading system for simulation quality based on research and historical accuracy. Include details about how this grading system will be implemented and verified.\n5. Scalability and Performance: Consider the expected user load and define scalability and performance requirements. Identify potential bottlenecks and plan for future growth. Provide examples of strategies to ensure optimal performance under high-load conditions.\n6. Security and Privacy: Identify potential security and privacy concerns, and define measures to address them. Implement encryption, secure authentication, and data protection practices. Discuss the specific technologies or solutions that will be used in this regard.\n7. Monetization and Business Model: Explore potential revenue streams such as subscription models, in-app purchases, advertising, and partnerships. Define a sustainable business model that aligns with user needs and market trends. Consider different pricing strategies and their effects on user acquisition and retention.\n8. Compliance and Legal: Identify any relevant legal and regulatory requirements. Consult with legal experts to ensure compliance with data protection laws, intellectual property rights, and historical accuracy. Provide details about any necessary licenses or agreements that need to be in place.\n9. Documentation: Ensure that all development processes are well-documented for future reference and knowledge transfer. Discuss the tools and methodologies that will be used for documentation, such as wiki pages, design documents, and code comments.\n10. Timeline and Milestones: Estimate the time required to complete each task, and set milestones for key deliverables.",

    "description": "Design the overall system architecture, including components, modules, and their interactions. The design should consider scalability, performance, security, data management, simulation engine, user interface, integration with external services (e.g., payment gateways, historical data sources), and adhere to the project's scope and requirements. Furthermore, ensure the system architecture is modular, extensible, and maintainable. The design should also cover the following aspects: 1. Microservices architecture for scalability and fault tolerance, 2. Use of containerization technologies like Docker and Kubernetes for deployment and orchestration, 3. Database solutions (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) for data storage and management, 4. Implementing an event-driven architecture for efficient communication between components, 5. Load balancing mechanisms to handle high traffic, 6. Security measures such as encryption, authentication, and authorization, 7. Monitoring and logging infrastructure for troubleshooting and performance optimization, and 8. Document the design in a clear and concise manner.",
