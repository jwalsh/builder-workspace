Gather and document the project requirements, including the types of user interactions to analyze (e.g., clicks, hovers, scrolls, eye-tracking), the software applications to support (web, mobile, desktop, VR), the desired insights and suggestions (e.g., potential pain points, areas for improvement, user sentiment analysis), any platform specific requirements, and any other relevant constraints or considerations.\n2. Research existing tools and methodologies in the field of UX analysis and competitor analysis to ensure our tool is competitive, provides unique value, and addresses unmet needs.\n3. Collaborate with the design team and other stakeholders (e.g., product managers, researchers) to understand their needs, requirements, and ensure our tool's output can be easily integrated into various workflows and platforms.\n4. Create a comprehensive project roadmap outlining milestones, dependencies, and timelines.",
