    "description": "Revise the task to gather, document and refine the project requirements for ContinuousComplianceMonitor. This includes specifying the security standards and regulations to be monitored (e.g., HIPAA, PCI-DSS, SOC 2, ISO 27001), the organization's compliance policies, desired reporting mechanisms (e.g., dashboards, alerts, reports), monitoring mechanisms (e.g., log analysis, network monitoring, configuration management), integration points with existing systems (e.g., SIEM, ITSM, GRC tools). Identify stakeholders and their roles in the project, define the system architecture for data storage, processing, and visualization, outline security measures to safeguard sensitive data, provide examples of similar systems that could leverage or integrate with for improved functionality, and ensure documentation is comprehensive, clear, concise, and easily understandable by all stakeholders. Additionally, delineate the project's success criteria, identify potential challenges, and propose solutions to mitigate them. Finally, prioritize the requirements based on their importance and impact on the project.",
