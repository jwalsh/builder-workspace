    "description": "Gather and document the following requirements for the AIComposer system:\n1. Desired features (real-time composition, multiple music genres support, adaptive music, etc.) \n2. Supported music genres (pop, classical, jazz, electronic) \n3. Target platforms (Web, iOS, Android) \n4. Performance expectations (processing speed, memory usage, latency constraints if any) \n5. Integration with external music libraries or APIs (SoundCloud, Spotify API, MIDI files support) \n6. User interface requirements (customizable interfaces, intuitive controls, real-time feedback, accessible design considerations such as screen reader compatibility and keyboard navigation) \n7. Data privacy and security considerations (data anonymization, encryption, user consent management) \n8. Scalability and sustainability requirements \n9. API documentation standards and guidelines (if applicable) \n10. Any other relevant constraints or considerations. This includes, but is not limited to, accessibility, user experience, and the impact of AI on musical creativity.\nFor the initial stage, focus on defining high-level requirements.\nOnce completed, update the rfc_state to 'READY_FOR_REVIEW'.
