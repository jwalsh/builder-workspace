Include components for virtual reality rendering (VR), language learning modules, user interactions, error handling, and performance optimizations. Consider edge cases, adhere to best practices, and implement design principles such as SOLID and DRY. Provide detailed documentation and diagrams for each component and their interactions. Break down the architecture into modular, reusable sub-systems for efficient development and maintenance. Ensure that the system is secure, accessible, and can handle real-time user interaction in a VR environment. In addition, outline strategies for testing, deployment, and maintenance of the system.",
