Define the roles and responsibilities of each component, as well as the communication protocols and data formats. In addition, outline the strategies for integrating various urban systems such as traffic management, waste collection, and public safety using IoT devices and centralized data analytics. Provide a detailed design document that includes system diagrams and mockups, clearly explain how each component will interact with others in the system, and provide an overview of the system's resilience to ensure seamless operations in case of failures or downtime. Update the document as necessary based on feedback during the review process. Upon completion, this task will serve as a foundation for the subsequent development tasks.",
