    "description": "Design the overall architecture of the 3D printing system, including hardware components (printers, material handling systems, etc.), software systems (control software, design tools, etc.), and integration with other systems (ERP, inventory management, supply chain management, etc.). The architecture should be scalable, modular, maintainable, performance-optimized, secure, fault-tolerant, disaster-recoverable, and observable. This RFC proposes a cloud-native microservices architecture with a service mesh for resilience and monitoring. The proposed solution follows best practices in system design and aligns with the project's objectives. To ensure a robust and extensible design, it is recommended to conduct thorough research on existing 3D printing systems and industry best practices. Additionally, consider incorporating feedback from various stakeholders, including potential users of the facility, during the design process. It would be beneficial to clarify the specific responsibilities of each microservice, as well as the communication protocols between them. This RFC is now ready for review by the code-architect and other relevant team members. It is important to ensure that the design considers not only technical aspects but also user experience and accessibility. To move forward to the next state, it is recommended to update the rfc_state field to 'UNDER_REVIEW'.",
