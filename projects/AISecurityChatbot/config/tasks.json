    "description": "Update the project requirements document for the AISecurityChatbot. The document should include the following sections: chatbot functionality (e.g., natural language processing, knowledge base integration, query handling, error handling), security features (e.g., user authentication, data encryption, access controls, audit logging, incident response integration), integration with existing security systems and tools (SIEM, threat intelligence platforms, incident response workflows, ticketing systems), performance expectations (response times, scalability, availability), user interface design (web-based, mobile app, voice interface, accessibility considerations), data privacy considerations (data storage, retention policies, compliance with regulations, data minimization principles), system architecture design (e.g., frontend, backend, database, microservices architecture), development roadmap, milestones, and timelines for each stage of the project. The document should also outline the testing strategy, acceptance criteria, and quality assurance plan. Once completed, ensure that the document is updated regularly to reflect any changes in requirements or project progress. Note that design decisions will be made by the code-architect, frontend-developer, backend-developer, database-specialist, and devops-engineer. However, it would be beneficial to involve security-specialist for addressing security concerns and technical-writer for documenting the project requirements and design decisions. After completion, review and provide feedback from a code-architect perspective. If necessary, update the rfc_state field to 'REVIEW_REQUIRED' or 'IMPLEMENTATION_REQUIRED'.",
