    "description": "Update the project requirements document for the AISecurityChatbot. The document should include the following sections: chatbot functionality (e.g., natural language processing, knowledge base integration, query handling), security features (e.g., user authentication, data encryption, access controls), integration with existing security systems and tools (SIEM, threat intelligence platforms, incident response workflows), performance expectations (response times, scalability), user interface design (web-based, mobile app, voice interface), data privacy considerations (data storage, retention policies, compliance with regulations), and system architecture design (e.g., frontend, backend, database). The document should also outline the development roadmap, milestones, and timelines for each stage of the project. Once completed, ensure that the document is updated regularly to reflect any changes in requirements or project progress.",
