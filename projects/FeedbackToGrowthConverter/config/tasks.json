    "title": "System Architecture Design for FeedbackToGrowthConverter - Revised",
    "description": "This RFC proposes the overall system architecture and components for the FeedbackToGrowthConverter system. The design will encompass the following key components: 1) Feedback Ingestion Module (responsible for receiving, parsing, and validating feedback from various sources), 2) Feedback Processing Module (processes feedback to extract insights and identify patterns), 3) Personal Development Plan Generation Module (generates actionable personal development plans based on the processed feedback), 4) User Interface Module (provides an intuitive and engaging interface for users to access their feedback and development plans), 5) Data Storage Module (ensures secure and scalable storage of user feedback, generated plans, and system data). The design will consider scalability, maintainability, modularity, and performance optimizations. A high-level architecture diagram and detailed descriptions of each component's responsibilities and interactions will be provided, as well as a discussion on the potential use of microservices architecture for improved scalability and flexibility. Furthermore, the design should include a comprehensive error handling strategy to ensure system reliability, with clear documentation of each error type, expected occurrences, and suggested remedies. The design will also address data privacy and security concerns by implementing appropriate encryption and access control mechanisms. Lastly, the design will be modular, allowing for easy integration with third-party services or future system expansions. However, I would suggest adding a Feedback Analysis Module (6) that uses machine learning algorithms to further analyze the feedback and identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for improvement. Additionally, consider implementing an Alerting System (7) that notifies users when there are significant changes in their feedback or development plan status. The RFC is now ready for review and approval. Assigned to: code-architect.",
