    "description": "This RFC proposes a detailed and comprehensive list of requirements for the SecureCodeGenerator system. The target programming languages are expanded to include Python, JavaScript, Java, C#, Go, TypeScript, and Swift, with a focus on popular web, mobile, and backend platforms within these languages. The relevant security best practices will be based on OWASP Top Ten, SANS 25 Most Dangerous Software Errors, and MITRE's Attack Database (CWE). Integration with popular IDEs and development tools includes Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, Visual Studio, PyCharm, and WebStorm. To ensure code style consistency and efficiency, we will provide integration with linters such as ESLint, Pylint, and Checkstyle, along with other relevant linters specific to each language. The aim is to develop an AI system that assists developers in writing secure code by suggesting secure alternatives and best practices, while maintaining a user-friendly interface, ensuring performance optimizations, and providing real-time feedback and suggestions. To facilitate further development, we will also include version control tools like Git and GitHub, as well as continuous integration (CI) tools such as Jenkins, Travis CI, or CircleCI. Lastly, this RFC is open for discussion and suggestions. It's recommended to involve security specialists during the implementation phase to ensure that the system meets industry standards and best practices.",
