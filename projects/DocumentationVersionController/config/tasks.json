    "description": "This task aims to collect and document detailed requirements for the DocumentationVersionController system. The scope includes user stories, use cases, functional and non-functional requirements, and any relevant constraints or assumptions. To ensure alignment with stakeholder needs and expectations, we will engage in discussions with technical writers, developers, project managers, focusing on key aspects such as scalability, performance, security considerations, and the potential impact on existing systems. Upon completion of the requirements gathering phase, a detailed document outlining the system's functional specifications, including system architecture details, will be prepared.",

    "description": "Revised design of the overall system architecture, including components, data flow, and integration points with existing systems. The revised design includes the following aspects: versioning strategy (e.g., semantic versioning), conflict resolution strategies such as last-write-wins and merge-on-pull-request, access control through role-based and ACL mechanisms, implementation of audit trails, seamless integration with existing documentation tools, and consideration for performance and scalability requirements. The design also addresses security concerns by ensuring data integrity, confidentiality, and adherence to best practices. Additionally, the revised design considers potential future enhancements and expansion.",

The design should be able to handle large volumes of documents efficiently.\". Additionally, consider implementing features such as advanced search,\", tagging,\", and document analytics for better user experience. To ensure efficiency and scalability, it would be beneficial to utilize a hybrid approach that combines the best aspects of centralized and decentralized systems. For instance, adopting a distributed database system for the storage layer can help in scaling horizontally, while implementing a robust access control mechanism at the application level can improve security.",
