    "description": "This revised RFC aims to provide a comprehensive outline of the project scope and detailed requirements for VoiceUIOptimizer. The focus will be on defining the platform's design, testing, and optimization functionalities, with special attention given to compatibility with various applications across multiple platforms, scalability (performance and capacity limits), security (data encryption, user authentication, and potential third-party integrations for enhanced security measures), accessibility (ensuring usability for users with disabilities), and usability (providing a user-friendly interface for designers to easily create, test, and optimize voice user interfaces). The scope will also cover testing methodologies, optimization algorithms, and integration with existing development workflows. This document will serve as a guide for future development and will be reviewed by the team for feedback. Upon completion, the revised RFC will be presented to the project manager for approval.",
