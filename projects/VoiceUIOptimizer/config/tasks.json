    "description": "Clearly outline the scope of VoiceUIOptimizer and gather detailed requirements for its design, testing, and optimization functionalities. Identify key areas such as compatibility with various applications (specifying specific platforms), scalability (including performance and capacity limits), security (including data encryption and user authentication), accessibility (considering users with disabilities), and usability (providing a user-friendly interface for designers to easily create, test, and optimize voice user interfaces). The scope should also include testing methodologies, optimization algorithms, and integration with existing development workflows. Upon completion, provide a comprehensive document detailing the project's requirements for future development.",
