    "description": "Clearly define the scope of the Planetary Waste Heat Radiator system. The requirements include: \n1. Heat Collection: Define materials suitable for heat collection, temperature range, and collection efficiency. Consider low-cost and lightweight materials with high thermal conductivity.\n2. Radiation into Space: Determine the required radiating area, spectral properties, and thermal control to ensure effective radiation of excess heat into space.\n3. Energy Efficiency: Specify power consumption limits, heat transfer rate, and overall system efficiency targets.\n4. Additionally, consider any environmental impact assessments and safety measures necessary for this project.",
