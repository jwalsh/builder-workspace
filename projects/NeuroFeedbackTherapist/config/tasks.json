    "description": "Update the original description with more specific details about the task. Design the overall system architecture for the NeuroFeedbackTherapist project, encompassing both hardware and software components. Detail data flow, integration points, security considerations, scalability, and performance optimizations for real-time neurofeedback functionality while ensuring patient privacy and data security. Provide comprehensive documentation and diagrams in a clear and concise manner that can be easily understood by all stakeholders. Focus on using modular design principles to facilitate future upgrades and expansions of the system. Incorporate feedback mechanisms for continuous improvement, with special emphasis on creating a user-friendly interface for both patients and clinicians. Also, consider integrating machine learning algorithms for advanced neurofeedback analysis. Upon completion, conduct thorough testing and documentation before moving to implementation stage. Update the rfc_state field to 'READY_FOR_IMPLEMENTATION' once the design is approved.",
