The design should be based on the requirements gathered from the 'Requirements Gathering and Analysis' task, and it is expected to cover aspects such as the user interface, data storage, communication protocols, power management, and safety mechanisms. Please ensure that the design is modular, extensible, and future-proof.",

Design and implement secure data storage and transmission mechanisms for user data and system logs, ensuring compliance with privacy regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA. This encompasses encryption, access controls, and secure data transfer protocols (e.g., SSL/TLS).\n2. Implement techniques for anonymization and pseudonymization of sensitive data while maintaining the necessary granularity for system functionality.\n3. Investigate and propose solutions for data backup and disaster recovery, considering factors such as redundancy, off-site storage, and automated failover.\n4. Conduct regular security audits to ensure the continued integrity and confidentiality of user data. These audits should include both internal and third-party security assessments.\n5. Collaborate with other team members to incorporate secure data management practices into the overall system architecture design.\n6. Document all secure data management decisions, implementation details, and best practices for future reference.",
