Consider scalability, fault tolerance, security, and performance requirements. Incorporate modularity, maintainability, and extensibility principles to ensure the system's success. Integrate identified dependencies (Requirements Gathering and Analysis, Data Sources Identification) and any additional dependencies that may arise during design. Provide a preliminary timeline for completion, with milestones for key stages of the design process. Optimize the design for data-driven decisions and efficient trading strategies, focusing on improving system efficiency and accuracy. Additionally, consider integrating machine learning techniques for predictive modeling and real-time market analysis.",
