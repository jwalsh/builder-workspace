The gathered requirements should be prioritized based on their impact on the overall system and ease of implementation.",

The architecture should consider scalability, maintainability, security, and performance requirements. Ensure proper separation of concerns and modular design for easy extensibility and future enhancements. The architecture should address the following aspects: 1) Infrastructure provisioning and management, 2) Challenge hosting and deployment, 3) User management and authentication, 4) Scoring and leaderboard, 5) Administration and monitoring, 6) Security considerations (e.g., network isolation, access control, data encryption), 7) Logging and auditing, 8) Backup and disaster recovery, 9) Document the design for future reference and collaboration.",
