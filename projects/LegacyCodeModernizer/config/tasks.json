    "description": "This RFC aims to gather and document the detailed scope, goals, and requirements of the LegacyCodeModernizer project. The requirements should encompass both learning aspects (teaching old and new programming paradigms, focusing on popular and emerging languages), gamification aspects (challenges, rewards, leaderboards, badges system, progress tracking), platform's architecture (tiered architecture, microservices where applicable, clear modularization), scalability considerations, security measures (including data protection, privacy policies, secure coding practices), integration with popular development environments and IDEs if applicable, performance optimization best practices, accessibility standards compliance, mobile responsiveness, and outline the long-term maintenance and evolution strategy. The documentation should provide clarity on each of these areas, include use cases, wireframes, and UX/UI design principles for an engaging user experience. Upon completion, this RFC will be reviewed by the team before being moved to the 'NEEDS_IMPLEMENTATION' state.",

    "description": "Design the overall system architecture for the LegacyCodeModernizer project. This task encompasses the following aspects:\n\n- Modular and scalable architecture to accommodate future growth and changes\n- Separation of concerns (e.g., frontend, backend, database)\n- Determine whether to use microservices or monolithic architecture based on project requirements and potential long-term scalability considerations, with an emphasis on microservices for better modularity and scalability.\n- API design and communication protocols between components, emphasizing RESTful APIs for flexibility and ease of integration, and ensuring compatibility with GraphQL for richer interactions.\n- Database design (relational, NoSQL, or a combination), with normalization for relational databases and appropriate data modeling for NoSQL databases, and considering the use of a hybrid approach to leverage both worlds when appropriate.\n- Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms using OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect standards for secure user management, along with role-based access control (RBAC) for more granular permissions.\n- Caching strategies to improve performance, including Redis for fast data access and Memcached for high-throughput caching, with a focus on implementing multiple levels of caching to maximize efficiency.\n- Logging, monitoring, and error handling strategies using ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) stack for centralized logging and monitoring, and incorporating distributed tracing tools like Jaeger or Zipkin for deeper insights into system behavior.\n- Deployment and infrastructure considerations, utilizing cloud services such as AWS or Azure for scalable deployments and automated CI/CD pipelines, with a focus on containerization technologies like Docker and Kubernetes for easier management of services.\n- Security best practices, including input validation, encryption at rest and in transit, and strict access controls, along with vulnerability scanning tools such as OWASP ZAP to ensure the security of our application.\n- Integration with third-party services like code editors (e.g., Visual Studio Code), version control systems (e.g., GitHub), and continuous integration tools (e.g., Jenkins), ensuring compatibility and seamless collaboration between our platform and these popular tools.\n- Provide clear documentation of the proposed architecture for the technical writer to create comprehensive guides, with a focus on creating detailed API documentation using tools like Swagger or Postman.",
