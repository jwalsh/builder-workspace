This task encompasses the following aspects:\n\n- Modular and scalable architecture to accommodate future growth and changes\n- Separation of concerns (e.g., frontend, backend, database)\n- Microservices or monolithic architecture based on project requirements and potential long-term scalability considerations\n- API design and communication protocols between components, emphasizing RESTful APIs for flexibility and ease of integration\n- Database design (relational, NoSQL, or a combination), with normalization for relational databases and appropriate data modeling for NoSQL databases\n- Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms using OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect standards for secure user management\n- Caching strategies to improve performance, including Redis for fast data access and Memcached for high-throughput caching\n- Logging, monitoring, and error handling strategies using ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) stack for centralized logging and monitoring\n- Deployment and infrastructure considerations, utilizing cloud services such as AWS or Azure for scalable deployments and automated CI/CD pipelines\n- Security best practices, including input validation, encryption at rest and in transit, and strict access controls\n- Integration with third-party services like code editors (e.g., Visual Studio Code), version control systems (e.g., GitHub), and continuous integration tools (e.g., Jenkins)\n- Provide clear documentation of the proposed architecture for the technical writer to create comprehensive guides",
