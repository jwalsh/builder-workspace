    "description": "Gather and document the project's scope, goals, and requirements in detail. This includes but is not limited to user stories, technical specifications, and any constraints or assumptions. The requirements should cover both the learning aspects (teaching old and new programming paradigms) and the gamification aspects (challenges, rewards, leaderboards, etc.) of the platform. Furthermore, it is crucial to specify the platform's architecture, scalability, security measures (including data protection and privacy policies), integration with other systems if applicable, and performance optimization considerations. The documentation should also outline the platform's long-term maintenance and evolution strategy. Upon completion, this RFC will serve as a foundation for further task decomposition.",

    "description": "Design the overall system architecture for the LegacyCodeModernizer project. This task encompasses the following aspects:\n\n- Modular and scalable architecture to accommodate future growth and changes\n- Separation of concerns (e.g., frontend, backend, database)\n- Determine whether to use microservices or monolithic architecture based on project requirements and potential long-term scalability considerations\n- API design and communication protocols between components, emphasizing RESTful APIs for flexibility and ease of integration\n- Database design (relational, NoSQL, or a combination), with normalization for relational databases and appropriate data modeling for NoSQL databases\n- Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms using OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect standards for secure user management\n- Caching strategies to improve performance, including Redis for fast data access and Memcached for high-throughput caching\n- Logging, monitoring, and error handling strategies using ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) stack for centralized logging and monitoring\n- Deployment and infrastructure considerations, utilizing cloud services such as AWS or Azure for scalable deployments and automated CI/CD pipelines\n- Security best practices, including input validation, encryption at rest and in transit, and strict access controls\n- Integration with third-party services like code editors (e.g., Visual Studio Code), version control systems (e.g., GitHub), and continuous integration tools (e.g., Jenkins)\n- Provide clear documentation of the proposed architecture for the technical writer to create comprehensive guides",
