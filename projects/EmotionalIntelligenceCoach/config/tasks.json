    "title": "Define Project Scope and Requirements - Emotional Intelligence Coach AI System (Revised)",
    "description": "Clearly outline the project requirements for the Emotional Intelligence Coach AI system. This includes defining the scope of emotional intelligence coaching, simulated leadership challenges, desired user experience (UX), target audience, platform requirements (Web, Mobile, VR/AR), and integration with existing systems (if any). Additionally, detail the expected outcomes and success criteria. Clearly distinguish between functional (user-facing) and non-functional (performance, reliability, usability) requirements. Provide examples of specific emotional intelligence skills to be addressed, potential leadership scenarios, user personas, UX/UI wireframes, system integration points, performance benchmarks for the AI system, and realistic timelines for each task or feature. Include a list of APIs and SDKs that may be needed for integration. Also, consider edge cases and provide solutions for them. To facilitate understanding, break down the functional requirements into smaller tasks for easier implementation. The revised RFC addresses the following areas: Functional Requirements (updated), Non-functional Requirements, User Personas, Emotional Intelligence Skills, Leadership Scenarios, UI/UX Design (updated), Integration Points, APIs & SDKs, Edge Cases, and Timelines. Note that the Functional Requirements and UI/UX Design sections have been updated for clarity.",
