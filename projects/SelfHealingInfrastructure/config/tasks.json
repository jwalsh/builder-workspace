The focus will be on industry-standard authentication, authorization, data encryption, secure communication protocols (such as OAuth2, TLS/SSL), and access controls. The security strategy will encompass all aspects of the infrastructure, including physical infrastructure, software components, and data transmission. Adherence to best practices, regular reviews and updates for emerging threats, collaboration with team members, thorough documentation, testing, integration checks, and transitions to subsequent phases are essential. Additionally, consider implementing multi-factor authentication, intrusion detection systems, security incident response plans, and ensure alignment with relevant industry standards (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, etc.). Upon completion, the implementation state should be updated, and this task can then be assigned to a suitable team member for further development.",
