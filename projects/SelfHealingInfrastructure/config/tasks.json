The security strategy will cover all aspects of the system, from physical infrastructure to software components and data transmission. Ensure adherence to best practices while incorporating regular reviews and updates to address emerging threats and vulnerabilities. Collaborate with other team members during the implementation process, and maintain clear documentation for future reference. Upon completion, perform thorough testing and integration checks before moving to the next phase.",
