    "description": "Collect and document detailed requirements for the APIOrchestrator project, including desired features, performance goals, security considerations, integration points with existing systems, scalability requirements, compliance or regulatory requirements, and any additional non-functional requirements such as error handling and logging. Collaborate with various stakeholders to gather input on the system's design, architecture, and interaction with downstream API endpoints. Develop a comprehensive design document detailing the implementation of circuit-breaker workflows, eventually-consistent caches for high availability, and potential solutions to ensure high performance and reliability. This document should also include an initial architectural diagram that illustrates the system's components and their interactions.",
