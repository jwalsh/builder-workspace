    "title": "Gather Requirements and Define APIOrchestrator Architecture (Revised)",
    "description": "Collect and document detailed requirements for the APIOrchestrator project, including desired features, performance goals, security considerations, integration points with existing systems, scalability requirements, compliance or regulatory requirements, and any additional non-functional requirements such as error handling and logging. Collaborate with various stakeholders to gather input on the system's design, architecture, and interaction with downstream API endpoints. Develop a comprehensive design document detailing the implementation of circuit-breaker workflows, eventually-consistent caches for high availability, and potential solutions to ensure high performance and reliability. This document should also include an initial architectural diagram that illustrates the system's components and their interactions, as well as a clear breakdown of task decomposition for efficient execution. The document should outline strategies for monitoring and troubleshooting issues that may arise during operation, focusing on the use of logs, metrics, and alerts for proactive management. In addition, consider the potential impact on other system components and services due to changes in the APIOrchestrator, and address these concerns in the design document. Ensure that the document adheres to the project's style guide and follows best practices for documentation, with a focus on clarity, conciseness, and organization. Provide clear examples and pseudo-code where necessary to aid understanding. When complete, share the document with stakeholders for review before moving forward with implementation. Note: To ensure a smooth process, it would be beneficial to schedule regular meetings or check-ins with stakeholders throughout the documentation phase to gather feedback and address any concerns in real time.",
