    "description": "Gather and document the requirements for the CodeHealthMonitor project. This includes specifying the types of codebases to be analyzed (e.g., programming languages such as Python, Java, JavaScript, open-source projects, in-house applications), the metrics to be used for technical debt quantification (code complexity, maintainability, test coverage, security vulnerabilities, and performance issues), desired output formats for reports and recommendations (HTML, PDF, CSV, API, and integrations with popular IDEs), and any additional project constraints or considerations such as scalability, privacy concerns, and internationalization. Upon completion, the document will serve as a guide for the development team. For further improvements, consider adding sections on collaboration features, continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) integration, and long-term maintenance strategies.",
