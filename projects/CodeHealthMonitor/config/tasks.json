    "description": "This RFC proposes the gathering and documentation of requirements for the CodeHealthMonitor project. The scope includes analyzing various codebases such as Python, Java, JavaScript, open-source projects, and in-house applications. Metrics for technical debt quantification are outlined, including code complexity, maintainability, test coverage, security vulnerabilities, and performance issues. Output formats for reports and recommendations are specified to include HTML, PDF, CSV, API, and integrations with popular IDEs. Additionally, considerations for scalability, privacy concerns, and internationalization are addressed. This document will serve as a guide for the development team. For further improvements, sections on collaboration features, continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) integration, and long-term maintenance strategies should be added. Upon completion, the document will be sent to task-decomposer for breakdown into tasks.",
