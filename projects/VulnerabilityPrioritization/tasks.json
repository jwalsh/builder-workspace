Consider the following aspects: \n\n1. Data Ingestion: Mechanisms to collect vulnerability data from various sources (e.g., scanners, threat intelligence feeds, manual input).\n2. Data Processing: Techniques for parsing, normalizing, and enriching vulnerability data.\n3. Data Storage: Appropriate database or storage solution for structured and unstructured vulnerability data.\n4. Prioritization Engine: AI/ML models and algorithms for vulnerability scoring and prioritization based on factors like asset criticality, attack vectors, and environmental context.\n5. User Interface: Web-based or CLI interface for security analysts to review and manage prioritized vulnerabilities.\n6. Integration: APIs or connectors for seamless integration with existing security tools, ticketing systems, and vulnerability management workflows.\n7. Scalability and Performance: Considerations for handling large volumes of vulnerability data and ensuring efficient processing and response times.\n8. Security and Access Control: Mechanisms for secure data handling, role-based access control, and auditing.",
