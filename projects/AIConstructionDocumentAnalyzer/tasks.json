Ensure scalability, performance, security, maintainability, accessibility, and data privacy requirements are met. Define high-level components, their interactions, and data flow. Strive for proper separation of concerns and modular design for easier maintenance and future enhancements. Address challenges like handling large document volumes, parallel processing, and efficient data retrieval. Propose suitable technologies and frameworks for each component (e.g., TensorFlow for AI model, Django or Flask for backend, React for frontend). In addition, consider implementing advanced features such as real-time analysis, version control, and user customization. Discuss the potential impact on other tasks and suggest a phased approach to implement these features. Update the 'rfc_state' field if the RFC is ready for the next state.",
