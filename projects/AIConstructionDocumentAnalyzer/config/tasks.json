    "description": "Design the overall system architecture for AIConstructionDocumentAnalyzer, focusing on a robust OCR and NLP approach. The design will include an AI model, document processing pipeline, user interface components, data storage, deployment strategy, ensuring scalability, performance, security, maintainability, accessibility, and data privacy. High-level components, their interactions, and data flow will be defined for proper separation of concerns and modular design. Address challenges such as handling large document volumes, parallel processing, and efficient data retrieval. Implement advanced features like real-time analysis, version control, and user customization. Utilize TensorFlow for AI model, Django or Flask for backend, React for frontend. Consider technologies like Tesseract (OCR), NLTK/Spacy (NLP), PostgreSQL (data storage), AWS Lambda (deployment). Include unit testing as part of the development process to ensure code quality. Update the 'rfc_state' field once this RFC is ready for implementation.",
