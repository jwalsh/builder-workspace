    "description": "Design the overall system architecture for the VisualDataSummarizer project. This includes defining the data processing pipeline, visualization components, user interface, and data storage. Consider scalability, performance, modularity, and maintainability. Outline the key components, their responsibilities, and how they interact with each other. Detail the approach for handling complex data sets and lengthy text documents, and propose solutions for improving accessibility and usability. Suggest mechanisms for monitoring performance, diagnosing issues, and implementing security measures. Additionally, specify the technology stack and frameworks to be used, ensuring compatibility and extensibility. Ensure that the design takes into account potential future features or improvements. Update the architecture design as necessary based on feedback received from team members during the review process. Upon approval, begin task decomposition and assign appropriate tasks to team members. For this RFC, provide more specific details about data preprocessing techniques, visualization algorithms, and user interface wireframes. Also, propose a strategy for ensuring compatibility with various operating systems and browsers.",
