    "description": "Thoroughly gather and document the detailed requirements for the PrivacyEnhancingAnalytics system. This includes specifying the privacy techniques to be implemented (e.g., differential privacy, secure multi-party computation, homomorphic encryption), the types of data to be analyzed (e.g., user data, financial data, healthcare data), the desired level of privacy protection, the required performance and scalability considerations, and any relevant regulatory or compliance requirements. Moreover, clarify the interaction between these techniques and their impact on system performance and usability. Also, consider the potential integration with existing systems and provide a roadmap for future updates.",
