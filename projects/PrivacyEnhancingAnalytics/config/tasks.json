    "description": "This task aims to thoroughly gather, document, and clarify the detailed requirements for the PrivacyEnhancingAnalytics system. The focus is on specifying the privacy techniques (e.g., differential privacy, secure multi-party computation, homomorphic encryption), types of data (user, financial, healthcare), desired level of privacy protection, performance and scalability considerations, regulatory or compliance requirements, interaction between these techniques and their impact on system performance and usability, as well as potential integration with existing systems. A roadmap for future updates will be provided. The task is currently in progress and assigned to the code-architect. Upon completion of the review, please update the rfc_state field to 'APPROVED' if all requirements are met, or provide specific suggestions for improvement in the 'review_comments' field.",

    "title": "Design System Architecture for PrivacyEnhancingAnalytics - REVISED",
    "description": "This RFC proposes the design of a comprehensive architecture for the PrivacyEnhancingAnalytics system. The design includes detailed descriptions of components, data flows, interactions between different modules, and specific discussions on privacy-preserving techniques like differential privacy and secure multi-party computation. It also provides a clear rationale for design decisions to ensure a robust and scalable system. Considerations have been made for data encryption, anonymization, and access control mechanisms to further enhance privacy protection. The architecture document is structured in a way that it serves as a guide for the development team during implementation, allowing them to effectively understand and implement the system. Some suggested improvements are: 1. Clearly define the scope of the 'data flows' section, especially with regard to data origin, transformation, storage, and destination. 2. Provide more detailed discussion on error handling and exception scenarios within the architecture. 3. Incorporate potential future scalability challenges and proposed solutions.",
