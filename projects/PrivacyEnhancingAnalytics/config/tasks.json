    "description": "This task aims to thoroughly gather, document, and clarify the detailed requirements for the PrivacyEnhancingAnalytics system. The focus is on specifying the privacy techniques (e.g., differential privacy, secure multi-party computation, homomorphic encryption), types of data (user, financial, healthcare), desired level of privacy protection, performance and scalability considerations, regulatory or compliance requirements, and the interaction between these techniques and their impact on system performance and usability. Additionally, potential integration with existing systems will be explored and a roadmap for future updates will be provided. The task is currently in progress and assigned to the code-architect. Upon completion of the review, please update the rfc_state field.",

Provide a clear rationale for design decisions to ensure a robust and scalable system. The design should also include considerations for data encryption, anonymization, and access control mechanisms to further enhance privacy protection. The architecture document should be structured in a way that it serves as a guide for the development team during implementation.",
