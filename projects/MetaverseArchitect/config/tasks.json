    "description": "Gather and document the comprehensive requirements for the MetaverseArchitect platform. This includes features, functionality, performance, scalability, security, and user experience considerations. Identify potential integrations with existing metaverse platforms or technologies. Specify the target audience, use cases, and key objectives. Outline the overall system architecture focusing on a clear separation of frontend, backend, database, and infrastructure components, as well as APIs for seamless integration. Address accessibility, localization, and extensibility considerations for a global user base. Provide design patterns, data structures, and documentation standards. Additionally, suggest performance benchmarks and testing strategies to ensure the platform's reliability under various load conditions. Also, consider the potential impact of emerging technologies in the metaverse, such as VR/AR, and discuss their integration, emphasizing the importance of cross-platform compatibility. Lastly, propose a timeline for task completion, including milestones, and suggest a strategy for ongoing maintenance and updates. Provide initial wireframes or mockups to help visualize the platform's layout. For this task, focus on breaking down the task into smaller subtasks for easier implementation. This breakdown should be documented in detail, including estimated effort, dependencies, and potential challenges.",

    "description": "Revise the design of the overall system architecture, focusing on scalability, performance, security, extensibility, maintainability, modularity, and adherence to best practices. The revised design will serve as a foundation for the MetaverseArchitect platform, ensuring it is robust and adaptable to emerging technologies in the metaverse. This revision will also consider the implications of each decision on future features, integrations, and maintenance. Please review and provide feedback before moving forward. Key points to consider include: 1) Balancing technical excellence with practical constraints such as time and resources; 2) Ensuring scalability for handling large-scale virtual environments; 3) Prioritizing security to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access; 4) Making the system extensible to accommodate new technologies and features as they emerge; 5) Designing for maintainability to reduce long-term costs and complexity. After incorporating feedback, the design can move to the next state.",
