    "description": "Design the overall system architecture, including components, interfaces, and data flows. Consider the following aspects:\n1) User authentication and authorization mechanisms (Implement OAuth for a seamless user experience and improved security). 2) Collaboration and communication features for users to share ideas and provide feedback (Consider implementing a real-time messaging system with threading capabilities, ensuring end-to-end encryption for privacy. Provide UI/UX design suggestions for an intuitive and engaging user interface). 3) Data storage and management for user-generated content and simulation data (Normalize the database schema for better performance and scalability, considering using a managed NoSQL database service such as AWS DynamoDB or Google Cloud Firestore. Provide guidance on indexing strategies and data partitioning for efficient data access). 4) Simulation engine for modeling and testing new ideas (Use microservices architecture for improved scalability and modularity, ensuring each microservice has its own database to minimize contention. Consider implementing serverless functions for on-demand processing using AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions. Provide suggestions for simulation algorithms and optimization techniques). 5) Reporting and analytics for tracking innovation progress (Implement a dashboard with drill-down capabilities to provide in-depth insights, allowing for customizable report generation using tools like Tableau or PowerBI. Provide recommendations on key performance indicators and data visualization best practices). 6) Integration with existing systems or external services if needed (Create clear API documentation and SDKs for easy integration, ensuring compatibility with popular platforms and following best practices such as RESTful APIs and OpenAPI specification. Provide guidance on versioning strategies and backward compatibility considerations). 7) Scalability and performance considerations for handling a large user base (Consider implementing caching mechanisms, load balancing, and horizontal scaling strategies, as well as using edge computing solutions like AWS CloudFront or Google Cloud CDN. Provide suggestions for auto-scaling policies and capacity planning). 8) Security measures to protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access (Implement encryption at rest and in transit, follow best security practices such as least privilege principle, defense-in-depth strategy, and regular penetration testing and vulnerability assessments. Consider implementing Zero Trust Architecture principles. Provide guidance on secure coding practices and secure data handling procedures). 9) Error handling and edge cases (Design resilient systems that can handle failures gracefully and provide meaningful error messages to users, ensuring proper logging for troubleshooting purposes. Provide suggestions for circuit breakers and retry mechanisms).",
