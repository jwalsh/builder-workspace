    "description": "Gather and document the project requirements in detail. This includes the desired materials/compounds, production goals, constraints (technical, regulatory, ethical, safety), potential environmental impact, stakeholder needs (e.g., researchers, investors, end-users), and any additional technical details or design specifications. Additionally, outline key milestones, project timelines, resource allocation, and dependencies where appropriate. The task also requires consideration of long-term maintenance and scalability requirements, as well as potential future integration with existing systems within the organization. It is important to consider both short-term and long-term research directions in the field of synthetic biology when defining these requirements.",
