    "description": "Detailed requirements for the CellularAutomatonUniverse project are being gathered and documented. The requirements will include specific cellular automata types (e.g., Conway's Game of Life, Wolfram Rules), scale of simulations (number of cells, grid size), desired outputs such as real-time, 3D visualizations, data exports, performance requirements (FPS, response time), scalability requirements (multi-threading, distributed computing), and additional features or constraints. The aim is to create a versatile and efficient simulation platform for complex system modeling, ranging from biological processes to cosmic phenomena. Note that this task may be refined further as more information is gathered.",
