    "description": "Detailed requirements for the CellularAutomatonUniverse project are being gathered and documented. The requirements will include specific cellular automata types (e.g., Conway's Game of Life, Wolfram Rules), scale of simulations (number of cells, grid size, and dimensions for 3D visualizations), desired outputs such as real-time visualizations, data exports in various formats, performance requirements (Frame Per Second (FPS) target, response time), scalability requirements (multi-threading, distributed computing, containerization solutions like Kubernetes and potential use of cloud services), integration with data analysis tools for post-processing of generated data, and additional features or constraints. The aim is to create a versatile, efficient, and extensible simulation platform for complex system modeling, ranging from biological processes to cosmic phenomena. Note that this task may be refined further as more information is gathered. Additionally, it would be beneficial to consider potential integration with machine learning algorithms for pattern recognition and prediction.",
