    "description": "Revise and expand the requirements for the ConflictResolutionAdvisor system. This includes, but is not limited to: types of conflicts (workplace harassment, communication breakdown, conflict of interests), target users (employees at all levels, human resource personnel), desired outcomes (resolution suggestions, mediation techniques, communication strategies). Define project scope and create a high-level system architecture. Consider edge cases, error handling mechanisms, performance optimizations, scalability considerations, accessibility features, and security measures. Ensure cultural sensitivity of the suggestions provided by the system, making them appropriate across various geographical regions. Document each requirement and its associated use case for future reference. Incorporate feedback from diverse cultural perspectives. Update the task type to 'enhancement' as this task is not just about creating new functionalities but also improving existing ones. Additionally, consider incorporating machine learning techniques to improve the system's ability to suggest personalized conflict resolution strategies based on user behavior and context. Furthermore, include a feature for anonymously reporting conflicts and incidents, and ensure compliance with relevant privacy laws and regulations. Update the task status to 'IN_PROGRESS' as it is being worked on.",
