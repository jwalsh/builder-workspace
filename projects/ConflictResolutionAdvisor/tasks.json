    "description": "Gather comprehensive requirements for the ConflictResolutionAdvisor system, including but not limited to: types of conflicts it should address (workplace harassment, communication breakdown, conflict of interests), target users (employees at all levels, human resource personnel), desired outcomes (resolution suggestions, mediation techniques, communication strategies). Define the project scope and create a high-level system architecture. Include edge cases, error handling mechanisms, performance optimizations, scalability considerations, accessibility features, and security measures. Prepare documentation for each requirement and its associated use case for future reference. Also, consider the cultural sensitivity of the suggestions provided by the system and ensure that they are appropriate across various geographical regions. Update the task type to 'enhancement' as this task is not just about creating new functionalities but also improving existing ones.",
