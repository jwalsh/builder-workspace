    "description": "Define the project scope, goals, and requirements. Identify target users (beginner to advanced programmers), programming languages to support (Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, Ruby, PHP). Prioritize desired features such as interactive tutorials, challenges, code editing tools, error handling assistance, community forums, version control system integration, and code sharing functionality. Also consider mobile app support as a potential future feature.\n\nPotential Features:\n1. Interactive Tutorials - High\n2. Challenges - High\n3. Code Editing Tools - High\n4. Error Handling Assistance - High\n5. Community Forums - Medium\n6. Version Control System Integration - Medium\n7. Code Sharing Functionality - Increased to Medium priority (as it can facilitate learning and collaboration)\n8. Mobile App Support - Medium (considering potential benefits for users on-the-go)\n9. Performance Monitoring and Optimization - Low (important for maintaining a smooth user experience, but can be addressed later)",
