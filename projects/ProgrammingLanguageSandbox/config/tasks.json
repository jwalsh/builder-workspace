    "description": "Define the project scope, goals, and requirements. Identify target users (beginner to advanced programmers), programming languages to support (Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, Ruby, PHP). Prioritize desired features such as interactive tutorials, challenges, code editing tools, error handling assistance, community forums, version control system integration, and code sharing functionality. Also consider mobile app support as a potential future feature.\n\nPotential Features:\n1. Interactive Tutorials - High\n2. Challenges - High\n3. Code Editing Tools - High\n4. Error Handling Assistance - High\n5. Community Forums - Medium (consider implementing real-time notifications for enhanced user engagement) - Updated: Adding a feature to allow users to customize their notification preferences.\n6. Version Control System Integration - Medium (support Git and GitHub for starters)\n7. Code Sharing Functionality - Increased to High priority (as it can facilitate learning, collaboration and code review) - Updated: Prioritize real-time code sharing functionality for immediate collaboration.\n8. Mobile App Support - Medium (considering potential benefits for users on-the-go, make sure to address usability and performance issues) - Updated: Consider partnering with a mobile app development team early in the project timeline to ensure smooth implementation and user experience.\n9. Performance Monitoring and Optimization - Moved from Low to Medium priority as it can impact overall product quality\n10. Accessibility Compliance - Medium (ensure the platform is accessible to all users including those with disabilities) - Updated: Collaborate with accessibility experts to ensure platform meets or exceeds current standards.\n11. Documentation and Knowledge Base - Low (create easy-to-understand documentation for various features of the platform, including tutorials)\n12. Security Measures - High (implement robust security measures to protect user data)",
