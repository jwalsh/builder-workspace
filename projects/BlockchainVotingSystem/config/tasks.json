    "description": "Gather, document, and prioritize all functional and non-functional requirements for the BlockchainVotingSystem. These should include security, scalability, user experience considerations (usability, accessibility), compliance with relevant laws and regulations, performance benchmarks, specific blockchain technologies to be used, and any additional requirements such as integration with third-party services or APIs. The documentation should also detail the expected workflows of the system, and the security mechanisms to ensure the privacy and integrity of voter identities and votes. Furthermore, consider the potential for future expansions or modifications of the system. Upon completion, review and revise as necessary before seeking final approval.",
