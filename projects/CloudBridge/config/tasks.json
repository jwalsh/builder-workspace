    "description": "Collaborate with relevant teams (Networking, Security, Operations) to collect, document, and understand the technical requirements for integrating on-premises infrastructure with cloud networking infrastructure. This includes: a) Understanding the existing on-premises network topology; b) Identifying security requirements, compliance regulations, and desired cloud networking architecture; c) Gathering stakeholder requirements and constraints through interviews or workshops. The output will be a comprehensive document detailing the technical requirements for the CloudBridge project. Additionally, consider providing an initial outline of the document to facilitate its organization and ensure all necessary sections are covered.",
