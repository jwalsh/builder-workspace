    "description": "Gather requirements from stakeholders across different departments, define the project scope, and document the expected features and functionalities of the CrossFunctionalRFCCollaborator tool. Ensure to include requirements for user authentication, access control, version control, and collaboration features (e.g., commenting, reviewing, approving changes). Consider scalability, performance, security aspects as well, focusing on areas such as data protection, user privacy, and system resilience. In addition, specify minimum viable product (MVP) features, non-functional requirements such as usability, reliability, maintainability, and any potential integration points with existing systems. For collaboration features, consider support for real-time communication, integrating with popular project management tools, and ensuring seamless cross-department collaboration. Lastly, provide clear guidelines for documentation and version control to ensure traceability of changes and facilitate future maintenance.",
