This includes input methods (e.g., text, voice), output formats (e.g., text, visualizations), navigation, accessibility considerations (screen readers, color contrast, etc.), responsive design for various devices, and edge cases such as slow internet connections, limited screen space, and error handling. Consider the integration of real-time feedback and suggestions for users during their interaction with the assistant. Also, incorporate a feature to allow users to save and revisit their previous conversations. Include the following improvements: ensure the interface is intuitive and easy to navigate; explore the use of chatbot design principles for a more engaging user experience; and provide a clear and concise way for users to request help or support during their session.",
