    "description": "Define the specific requirements for the drone transport system in urban and rural areas. This includes autonomy, delivery zones, payload capacity, safety regulations (include FAA or equivalent for each region), environmental considerations, navigation systems (GPS, LIDAR, etc.), communication protocols (5G, Wi-Fi, etc.), power sources (batteries, solar, etc.), maintenance procedures, redundancy mechanisms, collision avoidance systems, data encryption, user interface design, and further details such as security measures, privacy considerations, testing and validation procedures, and compliance with international standards. Also, consider the integration of drones with existing transportation infrastructure, traffic management systems, and smart city initiatives.",
