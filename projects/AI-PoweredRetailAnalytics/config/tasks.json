    "description": "Create a comprehensive document outlining the project's scope, objectives, and detailed requirements. This includes identifying the types of retail data to be analyzed (e.g., sales, inventory, customer preferences, market trends), desired insights (e.g., predictive analytics, trend forecasting, demand prediction), stakeholder needs (retailers, suppliers, customers), functional requirements (real-time analysis, scalability, user-friendly interface, integration with popular POS systems, A/B testing capabilities, adaptive learning models, and a dashboard for easy data visualization), non-functional requirements (security, privacy, reliability, accessibility), performance expectations (latency, throughput), and error handling mechanisms. Additionally, consider the need for an option to export reports in various formats and a mechanism for user feedback and continuous improvement. The AI-driven platform aims to optimize inventory in the retail sector by providing actionable insights that drive strategic decision-making. Ensure the document addresses the legal and ethical implications of data collection and usage, especially regarding consumer privacy. Lastly, provide a clear roadmap for future updates based on user feedback and technological advancements.",
