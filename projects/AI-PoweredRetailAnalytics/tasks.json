    "description": "Create a comprehensive document outlining the project's scope, objectives, and detailed requirements. This includes identifying the types of retail data to be analyzed (e.g., sales, inventory, customer preferences, market trends), desired insights (e.g., predictive analytics, trend forecasting, demand prediction), stakeholder needs (retailers, suppliers, customers), functional requirements (real-time analysis, scalability, user-friendly interface), and non-functional requirements (security, privacy, reliability). The AI-driven platform aims to optimize inventory in the retail sector by providing actionable insights that drive strategic decision-making.",
