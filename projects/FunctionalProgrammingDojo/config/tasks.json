    "description": "Thoroughly document the detailed requirements for the FunctionalProgrammingDojo project. This includes identifying the target audience (programmers, students, educators), learning objectives (understanding functional programming concepts, solving problems using functional programming), functional and non-functional requirements (user interface design, scalability, performance, accessibility, security), constraints (limited resources, timeframe), assumptions (learner's basic understanding of programming), technical considerations (choice of language, platform compatibility, mobile responsiveness), and user stories. Seek feedback from educators, students, and industry professionals to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the needs, and incorporate their suggestions when appropriate.",

    "description": "Revised design of the overall system architecture for the FunctionalProgrammingDojo. This includes client-side and server-side components, data storage, and external integrations or dependencies. The architecture prioritizes modularity, scalability, maintainability, edge cases handling, error management, performance optimizations, and follows microservices architecture to enhance flexibility and scalability. Suggestions for improvements include: 1) Utilize a service mesh like Istio for microservice management and communication. 2) Consider using containers with Docker for better portability and consistency. 3) Implement a proper logging and monitoring system to ensure smooth operation and easy troubleshooting. 4) To make the application more interactive, explore adding real-time data processing capabilities through tools like Apache Kafka or AWS Kinesis.",
