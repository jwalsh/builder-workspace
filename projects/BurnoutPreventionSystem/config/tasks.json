Ensure scalability, fault tolerance, security, privacy, performance requirements are met while considering compliance with relevant regulations and industry standards (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA), and making the design future-proof for potential changes and updates. The design should incorporate principles of usability, accessibility, and inclusivity. Provide clear documentation for each component and its integration points. Due to the complexity of this task, it would be beneficial to decompose this task into smaller tasks for easier implementation. Please provide a detailed breakdown of these subtasks in the 'Define Project Scope and Requirements' RFC. Ensure that these subtasks are assigned appropriately among team members.",
