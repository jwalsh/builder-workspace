This includes identifying data sources (e.g., employee work hours, project deadlines, workload distribution), defining monitoring metrics (e.g., overtime hours, consecutive working days, task completion rates, stress levels, productivity trends), establishing warning criteria (e.g., thresholds for overtime, workload imbalance, stress levels), specifying recommended actions (e.g., workload redistribution, mandatory time off, counseling, mental health resources recommendations), and outlining the user interface design for the system's interaction with employees and management. Also, consider the potential integration with existing HR or project management systems.",
