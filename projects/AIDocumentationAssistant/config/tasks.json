    "description": "Design the overall system architecture for the AI Documentation Assistant. The design will encompass components, data flow, integration points, and key considerations such as scalability, performance, maintainability, security, fault tolerance, extensibility, edge cases, error handling, and performance optimizations. The design will be broken down into modular and reusable components to facilitate future enhancements. Specific focus will also be given on the development of an efficient search functionality for quick content retrieval, as well as incorporating AI technologies such as NLP (Natural Language Processing) and machine learning algorithms to improve content suggestions and format recommendations. Additionally, the design should be flexible to accommodate potential future integrations with other tools or systems, and provide support for real-time collaboration features. The architecture will also take into account the need for offline functionality and robust data storage solutions. To ensure the project's success, regular communication and collaboration with the cross-functional team members is essential. It is recommended to consult with the frontend-developer, backend-developer, database-specialist, devops-engineer, qa-tester, security-specialist, technical-writer, and project-manager for their input on specific areas of expertise. The design should aim to minimize API calls for efficient performance. Also, consider implementing caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data to reduce the load on the server and improve performance. If needed, explore the possibility of using containerization technologies like Docker or Kubernetes for easier deployment and scaling. Lastly, provide documentation for the architecture design for future reference and ensure that the design is well-documented and easily understandable by all team members. To facilitate this, consider creating diagrams and flowcharts where appropriate. Update the rfc_state field to 'READY_FOR_IMPLEMENTATION' once the design is finalized and approved by all relevant parties.",

The implementation should consider industry standards and best practices such as OWASP Top 10 and NIST Cybersecurity Framework. Additional steps include regular security audits, penetration testing, and implementing a proper incident response plan. To ensure seamless integration with the rest of the system, coordinate with the Design System Architecture team to understand their security measures and suggest necessary updates to the Design System Security Document if needed. Once the design system security is understood, collaborate with the Backend Developers to implement these security measures in the application. Upon implementation, conduct a code review to ensure adherence to best practices and standards, and make any necessary adjustments. To ensure smooth collaboration, assign the task to Code Architect for initial review and task decomposition.",

The pipeline should encompass the following stages: linting, unit testing, integration testing, build, deployment to staging and production environments with rollback mechanisms in case of deployment failures. Security scanning and code quality checks will be included using tools such as Snyk, SonarQube or similar. To ensure scalability and portability, consider using containerization (Docker) and orchestration tools (Kubernetes). For a streamlined CI/CD process setup, utilize GitHub Actions for simple workflows, and Jenkins for more complex ones. Since this task involves both frontend and backend development, assign it to 'frontend-developer' and 'backend-developer'. To ensure thorough review and improvement suggestions, assign a 'code-architect' as well. Break down the task into smaller subtasks: Linting, Unit Testing, Integration Testing, Building, Deployment, Security Scanning, Design System Integration (to incorporate the dependency on 'Design System Architecture'). Once these subtasks are completed, merge them back into the main task. Update the dependencies to include 'Project Setup' and 'Design System Architecture'. For better clarity, clarify that for the 'Design System Integration' subtask, the focus should be on integrating the AIDocumentationAssistant application with the existing design system, rather than creating a new design system. If the current RFC state is indeed 'IMPLEMENTING', no change is needed in this field. However, I suggest adding a timeline for completion to provide better visibility. To ensure proper progress tracking, update the 'assigned_to' field to 'task-decomposer' initially, then assign subtasks as appropriate and update the field accordingly.",
