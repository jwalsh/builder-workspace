    "description": "Gather and document the detailed requirements for the AI-enhanced Security Operations Center (SOC), including the desired features, integrations, performance expectations, security considerations, and compliance with industry standards and regulations. The requirements should cover the following aspects:\n\n- Threat detection capabilities (e.g., network traffic analysis, log monitoring, endpoint monitoring)\n- AI/ML models for anomaly detection, threat classification, and prioritization\n- Integration with existing security tools and data sources (e.g., SIEM, firewalls, IDS/IPS)\n- Automation of triage and initial response actions (e.g., alert escalation, incident tracking, playbook execution)\n- User interface and reporting capabilities for SOC analysts\n- Scalability and performance requirements for handling large volumes of security data\n- Security and privacy requirements for handling sensitive data, emphasizing secure data storage, encryption, and access control\n- Compliance with relevant industry standards and regulations (e.g., NIST, PCI DSS, GDPR), considering periodic audits and updates to maintain compliance\n- Documentation of all components, including architecture diagrams, technical documentation, and user guides for easy onboarding and maintenance\n- Incorporate feedback from security specialists regarding the secure design and implementation of AI/ML models\n- Consider edge cases and potential false positives in the design of threat detection and anomaly detection systems\n- Ensure usability and accessibility of the user interface for SOC analysts, including support for multiple languages and screen readers for visually impaired users",
