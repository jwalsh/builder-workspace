    "description": "Gather and document extensive requirements for the autonomous vehicle fleet, covering vehicle specifications (e.g., sensors, actuators, power systems), operational scenarios (e.g., urban traffic, off-road conditions), safety standards (e.g., ISO 26262, UNECE R157, IEC 61508), regulatory compliance (e.g., NHTSA, EU regulations, UN Regulation No. 79), future scalability considerations (e.g., fleet size management, software updates and versioning strategies), interoperability with existing transportation infrastructure (e.g., traffic signals, parking systems), and potential research areas that could enhance the system's performance and user experience. Recommendations should include feasible solutions for each requirement, considering factors such as cost, development time, and impact on overall system architecture.",
