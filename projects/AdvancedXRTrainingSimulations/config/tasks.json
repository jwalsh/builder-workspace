This includes specifying the software components, hardware requirements, strategies for integrating with existing systems, addressing scalability, performance, security, and maintainability considerations, as well as providing recommendations for testing, documentation, and future iterations based on feedback and user research. The design should also take into account the needs of high-stakes industries such as aviation and healthcare. In addition, this RFC proposes to conduct a SWOT analysis, create prototypes for key simulation scenarios, perform a thorough review of related RFCs and industry best practices, and analyze the potential impact on privacy and data protection in these high-stakes industries. Upon completion, the design will be shared with the team for further discussion and refinement. Note: Dependencies have been updated to include 'Define Privacy and Data Protection Requirements' due to the nature of the project.",

Additionally, implement data privacy measures such as anonymization and encryption for user data.\n\n**Suggestions:** Consider adding the following features:\n1. Real-time analytics dashboard for trainers and administrators\n2. Data visualization tools for easier interpretation of results\n3. Implementing data retention policies to manage storage usage\n4. Incorporate A/B testing for experimenting with new training methods.\n5. Develop APIs for external integration with other systems, such as LMS or performance tracking tools.\n6. Enhance security by implementing regular backups and disaster recovery measures.\n7. Ensure compliance with industry standards and regulations related to data privacy and protection.\n8. Implement unit tests and system integration tests for the data management component.\n9. Document the design, implementation, and usage of the data management system in a clear and concise manner.",
