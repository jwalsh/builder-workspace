    "description": "This RFC proposes the gathering and documentation of requirements for the AIDocumentationQualityChecker tool. The scope includes defining the types of documentation it should handle (e.g., user manuals, technical specifications, API documentation), the quality metrics to be assessed (e.g., completeness, clarity, consistency, accuracy), desired output format (e.g., report, inline annotations), and any specific use cases or scenarios to consider. The output of this task will serve as a guide for further development stages.",

    "title": "Design System Architecture",
    "description": "Design the overall system architecture, including the main components, data flow, integration points, and considerations for scalability, performance, security, and maintainability. The architecture should include the following components: 1) A document ingestion module to accept various document formats (e.g., PDF, Word, Markdown), 2) A natural language processing (NLP) engine to analyze the document content, extract relevant information, and identify potential quality issues, 3) A quality assessment module to evaluate the documentation based on predefined criteria (e.g., completeness, clarity, consistency, adherence to style guides), 4) A reporting module to generate quality reports, recommendations, and visualizations, 5) A user interface for interacting with the system, uploading documents, and viewing reports, 6) A data storage component for storing documents, analysis results, and system configurations, and 7) An administration module for managing system configurations, user roles, and access controls. The architecture should also consider integration with version control systems (e.g., Git), content management systems (e.g., Confluence, SharePoint), and other relevant tools. Additionally, it should address concerns related to scalability (e.g., horizontal scaling, load balancing), performance (e.g., caching, asynchronous processing), security (e.g., authentication, authorization, data encryption), and maintainability (e.g., modular design, separation of concerns, testability).",
