    "description": "This RFC proposes the gathering and documentation of requirements for the AIDocumentationQualityChecker tool. The scope includes defining the types of documentation it should handle (e.g., user manuals, technical specifications, API documentation, code comments), the quality metrics to be assessed (e.g., completeness, clarity, consistency, accuracy, readability, accessibility), desired output format (e.g., report, inline annotations, suggest improvements), and any specific use cases or scenarios to consider such as handling different programming languages, integrating with popular IDEs, and considering accessibility guidelines. Additionally, the tool should be designed to provide real-time feedback during the documentation creation process. It would be beneficial to consult relevant teams (e.g., developers, technical writers) to ensure comprehensive coverage of requirements. A clear definition of success criteria and performance benchmarks should be established for evaluation purposes. The output of this task will serve as a guide for further development stages. To move forward, it is recommended that the project manager assign the 'task-decomposer' to decompose the tasks into smaller, manageable pieces. Upon completion, the next state for this RFC should be 'APPROVED'.",

    "title": "Design System Architecture",
    "description": "Design the overall system architecture, including the main components, data flow, integration points, and considerations for scalability, performance, security, and maintainability. The architecture should include the following components: 1) A document ingestion module to accept various document formats (e.g., PDF, Word, Markdown), 2) A natural language processing (NLP) engine to analyze the document content, extract relevant information, and identify potential quality issues, 3) A quality assessment module to evaluate the documentation based on predefined criteria (e.g., completeness, clarity, consistency, adherence to style guides), 4) A reporting module to generate quality reports, recommendations, and visualizations, 5) A user interface for interacting with the system, uploading documents, and viewing reports, 6) A data storage component for storing documents, analysis results, and system configurations, and 7) An administration module for managing system configurations, user roles, and access controls. The architecture should also consider integration with version control systems (e.g., Git), content management systems (e.g., Confluence, SharePoint), and other relevant tools. Additionally, it should address concerns related to scalability (e.g., horizontal scaling, load balancing), performance (e.g., caching, asynchronous processing), security (e.g., authentication, authorization, data encryption), and maintainability (e.g., modular design, separation of concerns, testability). The architecture design should be broken down into more specific tasks for easier implementation. To ensure a well-rounded design, I suggest the following additional components: 1) A monitoring and logging system to track the performance and health of the various components, 2) A feedback mechanism for users to provide input on the system's quality assessments, and 3) An API for third-party integration. To improve readability, I have also restructured the description into bullet points. The RFC is now ready for further review and refinement. Please assign it to a project manager or code architect.",
