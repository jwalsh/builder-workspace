    "description": "Task for refining the requirements of the FutureScenariosGenerator system. This includes defining the types of scenarios to be generated, input data sources, output formats, target users, and use cases. Functional requirements such as real-time processing capabilities, security measures, scalability, and integration with existing systems should be outlined. Non-functional requirements like performance expectations, error handling, user interface design, and documentation are also crucial considerations. The deliverable will be a comprehensive document detailing the system's functional and non-functional requirements. This task requires in-depth understanding of the project's purpose and goals and may involve input from various team members including project manager, frontend-developer, backend-developer, database-specialist, devops-engineer, qa-tester, security-specialist, and technical-writer. To ensure a comprehensive and well-rounded document, it is important to encourage collaboration and discussion within the team. The RFC is in DRAFT state and awaiting further input and refinement.",
