This includes specifying the types of scenarios to be generated, input data sources, output formats, target users, and use cases. Additionally, we should outline functional requirements such as real-time processing capabilities, security measures, scalability, and integration with existing systems. Non-functional requirements like performance expectations, error handling, user interface design, and documentation should also be considered. The deliverable will be a comprehensive documentation detailing the system's requirements.",
