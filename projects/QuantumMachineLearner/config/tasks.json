    "title": "Define Project Scope and Requirements (Revised)",
    "description": "This RFC proposes a comprehensive gathering and documentation of requirements for the Quantum Machine Learning project. The focus will be on defining the scope of quantum machine learning algorithms and infrastructure, targeting optimization problems such as portfolio optimization, logistics routing, etc., along with associated performance criteria (runtime, accuracy, scalability). Additionally, this task aims to detail integration with existing systems (APIs, libraries, frameworks), scalability considerations, future-proofing strategies, potential application areas beyond finance and logistics (e.g., materials science, chemistry simulation, etc.), project timeline, resources needed, and key milestones. This review also encourages exploration of alternative algorithms and optimization techniques for enhanced performance.",
