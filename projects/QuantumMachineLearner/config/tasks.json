These should include: target optimization problems (e.g., portfolio optimization, logistics routing), performance criteria (e.g., runtime, accuracy, scalability), integration with existing systems (APIs, libraries, frameworks), scalability considerations, future-proofing strategies, and exploration of potential application areas beyond finance and logistics (such as materials science, chemistry simulation, etc.). Additionally, outline the project's timeline, resources needed, and key milestones.",
