    "description": "This task involves gathering, documenting, and refining the project requirements, constraints, and success criteria for the CarbonCaptureOptimizer system. The scope includes understanding the current carbon capture processes, identifying key areas for optimization (e.g., energy consumption, material usage, waste reduction), defining system goals (e.g., maximizing efficiency, minimizing environmental impact, reducing costs, promoting sustainability), and establishing measurable success metrics such as carbon emissions reduction targets, cost savings, and operational efficiency improvements. Upon completion, a comprehensive requirements document will be produced for the project team.",

Consider scalability, maintainability, modularity, and performance optimizations. Define the roles and responsibilities of each component, as well as their interactions. Ensure proper error handling, logging mechanisms, and monitoring are in place. Address security considerations, such as data encryption, access controls, and secure communication channels. Incorporate best practices for AI system development, including explainability, fairness, and robustness. Additionally, consider the integration of real-time data processing and edge computing for efficient carbon capture optimization. Document the design decisions made and their rationale in the technical documentation.",
