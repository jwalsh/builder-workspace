    "description": "Design the overall architecture of the CarbonCaptureOptimizer system, including the AI model, data pipeline, user interface, and infrastructure. Consider scalability, maintainability, modularity, and performance optimizations. Define the roles and responsibilities of each component, as well as their interactions. Ensure proper error handling, logging mechanisms, and monitoring are in place. Address security considerations, such as data encryption, access controls, and secure communication channels. Incorporate best practices for AI system development, including explainability, fairness, and robustness. Additionally, consider the integration of real-time data processing and edge computing for efficient carbon capture optimization. Document the design decisions made and their rationale in the technical documentation, emphasizing the importance of collaboration with the cross-functional team. Update the project roadmap to reflect the completion of this task, once implemented. Upon completion, perform a code review before merging into the main branch, involving team members from various disciplines such as AI, backend, frontend, and DevOps for their expertise and feedback. Once the code review is complete, the task can be moved to 'IN_REVIEW' state, ready for the next stage of development. Update the rfc_state field accordingly.",
