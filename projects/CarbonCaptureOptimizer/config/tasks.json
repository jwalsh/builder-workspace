    "title": "Define Project Scope and Requirements - Revised",
    "description": "This task involves a comprehensive review and refinement of the project requirements, constraints, and success criteria for the Carbon Capture Optimizer system. The scope includes understanding current carbon capture processes, identifying key areas for optimization (e.g., energy consumption, material usage, waste reduction), defining system goals (e.g., maximizing efficiency, minimizing environmental impact, reducing costs, promoting sustainability), and establishing measurable success metrics such as carbon emissions reduction targets, cost savings, and operational efficiency improvements. The revised task will also involve outlining the desired AI algorithms, potential integration with existing systems, and data privacy concerns. Upon completion, a comprehensive requirements document, including the AI design specifications, will be produced for the project team. This task requires expertise in AI, carbon capture processes, and system architecture. To ensure clarity and efficiency, it is recommended to break down this task into smaller sub-tasks: 1. Research and understand current carbon capture processes (task-decomposer). 2. Identify key areas for optimization, such as energy consumption, material usage, and waste reduction (code-architect). 3. Define system goals, including maximizing efficiency, minimizing environmental impact, reducing costs, promoting sustainability, and potential AI algorithms (code-architect). 4. Establish measurable success metrics, like carbon emissions reduction targets, cost savings, and operational efficiency improvements (project-manager). 5. Outline the desired AI design specifications, including potential integration with existing systems and data privacy concerns (AI-specialist or task-decomposer). 6. Draft a comprehensive requirements document incorporating all the findings from the sub-tasks (technical-writer). Upon completion of each sub-task, the respective team member will review the work and provide feedback before moving onto the next step. The final document will be reviewed by the project manager and approved by the code architect. The priority remains 1, as this task is crucial for the successful development of the Carbon Capture Optimizer system. If necessary, please assign specific sub-tasks to team members based on their expertise. Once all sub-tasks are completed and reviewed, update the rfc_state field to 'REVIEW'.",

    "description": "Design the overall architecture of the CarbonCaptureOptimizer system, including the AI model, data pipeline, user interface, and infrastructure. Consider scalability, maintainability, modularity, and performance optimizations. Define the roles and responsibilities of each component, as well as their interactions. Ensure proper error handling, logging mechanisms, and monitoring are in place. Address security considerations, such as data encryption, access controls, and secure communication channels. Incorporate best practices for AI system development, including explainability, fairness, and robustness. Additionally, consider the integration of real-time data processing and edge computing for efficient carbon capture optimization. Document the design decisions made and their rationale in the technical documentation, emphasizing the importance of collaboration with the cross-functional team. Update the project roadmap to reflect the completion of this task, once implemented. Upon completion, perform a code review before merging into the main branch, involving team members from various disciplines such as AI, backend, frontend, and DevOps for their expertise and feedback. Once the code review is complete, the task can be moved to 'IN_REVIEW' state, ready for the next stage of development. Update the rfc_state field accordingly.",
