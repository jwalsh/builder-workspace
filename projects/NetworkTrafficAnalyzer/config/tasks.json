    "description": "Gather and document detailed requirements for the NetworkTrafficAnalyzer system. This includes: desired features (such as real-time traffic visualization, anomaly detection, and alerting mechanisms), performance goals (including real-time processing capabilities and scalability), security considerations (data encryption, authentication, access controls, intrusion detection, and incident response plans), integration with existing systems (e.g., firewalls, network equipment, SIEM solutions), compliance with relevant industry standards and regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.), clear documentation for each requirement to facilitate development, testing, and maintenance, a well-defined roadmap for phased implementation, and a focus on creating modular, extensible, and easily maintainable system architecture. The RFC also requests a thorough review of the requirements by all relevant stakeholders, including frontend-developer, backend-developer, database-specialist, devops-engineer, qa-tester, security-specialist, and technical-writer. Lastly, the RFC should be updated with more specific details on how each requirement will impact development timelines, resource allocation, and budget.",
