    "description": "Gather and document detailed requirements for the NetworkTrafficAnalyzer system. This includes: desired features (such as real-time traffic visualization, anomaly detection, and alerting mechanisms), performance goals (including real-time processing capabilities and scalability), security considerations (data encryption, authentication, access controls, intrusion detection, incident response plans, and threat intelligence integration), integration with existing systems (e.g., firewalls, network equipment, SIEM solutions, and log management tools), compliance with relevant industry standards and regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.), clear documentation for each requirement to facilitate development, testing, and maintenance, a well-defined roadmap for phased implementation, and a focus on creating modular, extensible, and easily maintainable system architecture. The RFC also requests a thorough review of the requirements by all relevant stakeholders: frontend-developer, backend-developer, database-specialist, devops-engineer, qa-tester, security-specialist, technical-writer, and project-manager. Additionally, it is recommended to break down the requirements into smaller, manageable tasks with defined acceptance criteria for each task. To ensure clarity, it is suggested to provide more specific details on how each requirement will impact development timelines, resource allocation, and budget. Once these updates are made, the RFC should be reviewed again by all stakeholders. If approved, update the rfc_state field to 'READY_FOR_APPROVAL'.",
