    "description": "Design the overall system architecture, including components, data flow, and integration points. Utilize Transfer Learning for faster training and other state-of-the-art machine learning techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). Outline each step of the data processing pipeline with specific algorithms or libraries to be used, such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, NumPy, and Pandas. Propose a scalable cloud-based database solution like AWS RDS or Azure SQL Database for data storage, considering data sharding and backup strategies. Provide wireframes/mockups for the user interfaces with interactive features, ensuring they are intuitive and user-friendly. Define APIs (including RESTful APIs) with clear endpoints and data exchange formats (e.g., JSON, XML). Outline a microservices architecture where applicable, taking into account service discovery mechanisms like DNS or service registries like Consul. Ensure the design addresses scalability, maintainability, performance requirements, security (HIPAA compliance for handling medical data, secure storage of sensitive data, encrypted communication), and compliance with relevant regulations such as GDPR. Outline the deployment strategy (e.g., containerization with Docker and Kubernetes, CI/CD pipeline) and infrastructure requirements (public cloud or hybrid cloud model). Address edge cases, error handling, and performance optimizations throughout the system architecture design. Consider incorporating AI explainability techniques like SHAP to improve trust in the system's predictions and provide interpretable results.",
