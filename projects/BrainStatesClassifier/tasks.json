    "description": "Design the overall system architecture, including components, data flow, and integration points. Define the AI model architecture (e.g., consider using Transfer Learning for faster training), data processing pipeline (outline each step with specific algorithms or libraries to be used), data storage strategy (consider scalable solutions like cloud-based databases), user interfaces (describe wireframes/mockups and interactive features), APIs (define endpoints and data exchange formats), and microservices architecture where applicable. Ensure the design considers scalability, maintainability, performance requirements, security (HIPAA compliance for handling medical data, secure storage of sensitive data, encrypted communication), and compliance with relevant regulations. Outline the deployment strategy (e.g., containerization with Docker and Kubernetes, CI/CD pipeline) and infrastructure requirements (public cloud or hybrid cloud model). Address edge cases, error handling, and performance optimizations throughout the system architecture design.",
