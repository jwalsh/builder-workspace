    "description": "Gather and document the requirements for the AITestSuite project. The focus should be on identifying the following: types of tests to be generated (unit, integration, end-to-end, performance, security), supported programming languages and frameworks (e.g., Python, Java, JavaScript, React, Angular, Node.js, Django, Flask, Spring Boot), desired user experience (CLI, GUI, IDE plugin), test coverage goals (e.g., 80% code coverage, with the ability to configure the threshold as needed), performance requirements (e.g., generate tests within X seconds for Y lines of code, with the ability to scale as the project grows and adjust according to hardware resources), security considerations (e.g., secure handling of sensitive data, input validation, OWASP top 10 compliance, integration with popular security scanners like OWASP ZAP or SonarQube for static code analysis), scalability and maintainability requirements (modular design for easy updating and extension, efficient use of resources, consideration for future growth, support for containerization technologies like Docker and Kubernetes), edge cases (e.g., test for unusual inputs, error conditions, boundary values), best practices for error handling and exception management, and guidelines for customizing the test suite to specific project needs.\n\nIn addition, consider the integration with existing CI/CD tools and test runners (e.g., Jenkins, CircleCI, GitHub Actions, Travis CI, TeamCity, Bamboo, pytest, JUnit, Maven, Webpack) and any other relevant details that will help in the successful implementation of this project.\n\nOnce the requirements are gathered, perform an initial feasibility study to estimate timelines and resources needed for the project.\n\nUpon completion, update the rfc_state field to 'READY_FOR_IMPLEMENTATION' and assign the task to the 'project-manager'.",
