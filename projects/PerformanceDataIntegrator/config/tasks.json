    "description": "Design the overall system architecture for the PerformanceDataIntegrator project. The system will integrate performance data from various sources (HRMS, CRM, timesheets etc.) using a combination of ETL, real-time streaming, and APIs. The design will include performance reporting components (dashboards, charts, alerts), with a focus on data security considerations such as encryption, anonymization, and access controls. Microservices architecture will be incorporated for scalability and modularity. A clear outline of the data flow within the system will be provided, emphasizing modularity, maintainability, and performance optimizations. Design patterns will be utilized to ensure efficient data handling and processing. Potential solutions for horizontal scaling to handle large volumes of data will be proposed. The design will also include a focus on incorporating best practices for microservices architecture, such as service discovery, load balancing, and circuit breakers.",
