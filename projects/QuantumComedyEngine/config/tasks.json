    "description": "This task aims to gather and document the functional and non-functional requirements for the QuantumComedyEngine. The updated requirements will cover aspects such as quantum computing integration, language processing (including natural language processing), concept exploration, humor generation algorithms, user interface design, potential interaction with external APIs or services (e.g., joke databases), and scalability considerations. Expected input and output formats, performance criteria, constraints, limitations, risks, and potential edge cases should be addressed. The requirements document will also outline the system's expectations in terms of handling large quantities of data efficiently and ensuring the humor generation process is scalable.",
