    "description": "Gather and document the comprehensive requirements for the BrainHealthMonitor system. Detailed scope includes: \n1. Types of neurological indicators to be tracked (e.g., cognitive function, sleep patterns, stress levels, physical activity, brain imaging data) \n2. Data sources (e.g., wearable devices, user input, medical records, third-party data providers) \n3. Target users (e.g., patients, healthcare providers, researchers, caregivers) \n4. Desired features (e.g., data visualization, alerts, recommendations, integration with electronic health records, data privacy and security measures, user authentication and authorization, scalability and performance considerations). Additionally, outline any potential integration or collaboration with existing systems or platforms.\nPlease note that the project is expected to comply with all relevant industry standards and regulations for medical devices and data privacy. Considering the long-term maintenance and evolution of the system, include a plan for future updates and scalability.\nLastly, ensure that accessibility considerations are addressed in the design and development process.\nPlease provide detailed wireframes or mockups for key user interfaces to clarify the intended user experience.\nIf possible, research and suggest potential AI/ML models that could be integrated into the system to improve its functionality.\nAfter reviewing the requirements, please provide a rough timeline for each phase of development and an initial estimate of resources required.",
