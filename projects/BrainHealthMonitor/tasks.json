    "description": "Gather and document the comprehensive requirements for the BrainHealthMonitor system. Detailed scope includes: \n1. Types of neurological indicators to be tracked (e.g., cognitive function, sleep patterns, stress levels, physical activity, brain imaging data) \n2. Data sources (e.g., wearable devices, user input, medical records, third-party data providers) \n3. Target users (e.g., patients, healthcare providers, researchers, caregivers) \n4. Desired features (e.g., data visualization, alerts, recommendations, integration with electronic health records, data privacy and security measures, user authentication and authorization, scalability and performance considerations). Additionally, outline any potential integration or collaboration with existing systems or platforms.\nPlease note that the project is expected to comply with all relevant industry standards and regulations for medical devices and data privacy.\nLastly, consider the long-term maintenance and evolution of the system as part of the requirements.",
