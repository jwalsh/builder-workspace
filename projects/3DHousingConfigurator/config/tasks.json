    "description": "Update the description to reflect changes. Design the overall system architecture, including the 3D modeling engine, user interface, cost estimation module, feasibility analysis components, and data storage solutions. Ensure scalability, performance, maintainability, security, and cross-platform compatibility. Define the communication protocols and data flow between components. Identify potential third-party libraries or tools to be integrated (e.g., Three.js for 3D modeling, TensorFlow.js for machine learning), as well as any proprietary components that need to be developed in-house. Ensure compliance with industry standards and best practices for 3D modeling, real-time cost estimation, and data security. Provide a detailed architecture diagram and documentation. Address the following additional considerations: 1) Modular design to allow for easy integration of future features and third-party tools. 2) Robust error handling and logging mechanisms. 3) User authentication and authorization mechanisms (e.g., OAuth). 4) Caching strategies for optimized performance, considering popular caching libraries like Redis or Memcached. 5) Deployment and scaling strategies for cloud or on-premises environments with a focus on containerization technologies like Docker and Kubernetes. 6) Implementing security measures such as encryption at rest and in transit, OAuth for user authentication, and regular security audits. Additionally, consider the use of microservices architecture for better scalability and maintainability. Suggest potential tools or frameworks that could help achieve this design, focusing on modern web and cloud technologies like React, GraphQL, AWS, Google Cloud Platform, and Serverless Architecture. If possible, explore options for serverless cost estimation and feasibility analysis components.",
