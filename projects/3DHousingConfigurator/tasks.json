    "description": "Design the overall system architecture, including the 3D modeling engine, user interface, cost estimation module, feasibility analysis components, and data storage solutions. Consider scalability, performance, maintainability, security, and cross-platform compatibility. Define the communication protocols and data flow between components. Identify potential third-party libraries or tools to be integrated, as well as any proprietary components that need to be developed in-house. Ensure compliance with industry standards and best practices for 3D modeling, real-time cost estimation, and data security. Provide a detailed architecture diagram and documentation. Address the following additional considerations: 1) Modular design to allow for easy integration of future features and third-party tools. 2) Robust error handling and logging mechanisms. 3) User authentication and authorization mechanisms. 4) Caching strategies for optimized performance. 5) Deployment and scaling strategies for cloud or on-premises environments.",
