    "description": "Design the overall architecture of the DeepSeaExplorer system, including components for autonomous navigation, specimen collection, data processing, and communication with surface vessels. Consider fault tolerance, scalability, real-time data processing requirements, integration with existing systems or standards used in deep-sea exploration (e.g., IEEE 1451, OPC UA), and outline a plan for testing and validation of the architecture design. This task includes creating system diagrams to visually represent the proposed architecture. To ensure a robust and efficient design, it is essential to consult with relevant experts (e.g., frontend-developer, backend-developer, database-specialist, devops-engineer) throughout the process. Incorporate feedback from the Security Specialist for secure data handling and communication, and collaborate closely with them during the design process. Additionally, consult with the Project Manager to ensure alignment with project objectives and milestones. Include performance optimization strategies in the design to meet real-time processing requirements. Once the design is complete, assign task decomposer for further decomposition into smaller tasks as needed. Update the status to IN_PROGRESS and assign this task to code-architect.",
