    "description": "The revised RFC aims to gather and document the comprehensive requirements for the LLMTuner tool. This includes specific use cases (e.g., text generation, sentiment analysis, question answering), target domains (scientific research, customer service, creative writing), desired features (real-time training, model versioning, collaborative workspace, data visualization, exportable reports), integration points with existing systems (APIs for data import/export, support for popular frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch, compatibility with common cloud services), data sources (public datasets, custom data sources, ability to integrate user-provided data), security and privacy considerations (data encryption at rest and in transit, anonymization techniques, compliance with GDPR, user authentication and authorization, addressing potential risks of model bias), scalability and performance requirements (support for large models, efficient training pipelines, optimization for various hardware configurations, consideration for edge devices), accessibility features (screen reader support, keyboard navigation, color contrast ratios to meet WCAG guidelines), and any other relevant constraints or assumptions. The task will also provide a clear roadmap detailing the development phases, timelines, and milestones for each phase, including key deliverables, target dates, and contingency plans. Additionally, it will include a section for potential risks and mitigation strategies, as well as a plan for user feedback and iterative improvements. Comparisons with similar tools or projects are encouraged to aid understanding. The updated RFC is now ready for the next state (i.e., 'task-decomposer' for further decomposition of tasks). To ensure alignment with our team's development practices, I suggest adding more emphasis on testability and maintainability of the codebase, as well as modularity to facilitate future updates and expansions.",
