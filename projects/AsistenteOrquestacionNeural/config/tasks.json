    "description": "Create a comprehensive technical document detailing the project's requirements for the neural interface-based assistant. This includes specifying its intended functionality, target user profiles, integration with existing systems, performance requirements (response time, memory usage), security considerations (authentication, authorization, encryption), accessibility requirements, any other relevant constraints or assumptions, potential future expansion plans, and guidelines for collaboration with the development team to ensure alignment with project goals and overall architecture. The document should be detailed enough to enable the Project Manager to create user stories and facilitate the creation of task breakdowns. Include clear milestones, timelines, and deliverables within the document, along with specific metrics for each requirement where appropriate. Consider potential scalability issues, error handling, and edge cases. Upon completion, reviewers should be able to use this document as a blueprint for the development process. If necessary, break down the requirements into smaller, manageable tasks. Once complete, update the 'rfc_state' field to 'REVIEWED'. Also, suggest potential improvements such as incorporating agile methodologies and adding a section for non-functional requirements like usability, scalability, and reliability. To ensure clarity, provide examples where appropriate. If any task dependencies are identified, update the 'dependencies' field accordingly.",
