The design should be adaptable to various screen sizes and types of input (touch, mouse, voice), and responsive to optimal user experience on various screen resolutions. Collaborate with the task-decomposer, other relevant team members, and the UI/UX designer to ensure alignment with the Design System Architecture, User Roles and Permissions definitions, and the list of Supported Devices and Platforms. The design should also take into account incorporating AI-driven features that can learn from user behavior and personalize the interface over time. Include detailed wireframes, mockups, and prototypes in your design proposal to facilitate clear communication with team members. Also, consider implementing feedback mechanisms for continuous improvement of the UI/UX, and conduct usability testing to validate the design. If possible, incorporate AI-driven feedback mechanisms that can learn from user interactions to improve the interface over time. Include these changes in the detailed wireframes, mockups, and prototypes. Update the design proposal with these changes and resubmit for review once ready. During the review process, be open to constructive feedback and iterate on the design as necessary. Once the design is approved, ensure that the UI/UX designer provides the final designs in a format suitable for handoff to frontend developers. Update the design proposal with these changes and resubmit for final approval.",

Incorporate robust multi-factor authentication and secure key management systems. Consider implementing a system for regularly updating security measures based on the latest threats and vulnerabilities. Ensure compliance with relevant privacy laws and regulations, including GDPR and CCPA. Additionally, consider implementing role-based access control (RBAC) for managing permissions within the ecosystem. For RBAC, use a combination of static roles and dynamic roles based on user behavior for flexible management. Incorporate user activity monitoring for more effective risk assessment. For security audits, consider using open-source tools such as OWASP ZAP or Nessus for thorough testing, and also implement regular automatic scanning. Update the security architecture design before proceeding with the implementation. In case of any updates to the RBAC system or user activity monitoring, ensure they are well documented.",

Collaborate with other team members as needed. Clearly define the scope of testing, outline the test data requirements, specify the tools and methodologies to be used in this process. Prioritize tasks within the testing strategy based on potential impact and complexity, and document these priorities in the task description. This will help guide developers in their work and ensure that critical areas are addressed first.
