Ensure a consistent and intuitive user experience across different devices and platforms, adhering to accessibility best practices (WCAG 2.1) and industry standards for UI/UX design (Material Design). The design should be adaptable to various screen sizes and types of input (touch, mouse, voice), and responsive to optimal user experience on various screen resolutions. Collaborate with the task-decomposer, other relevant team members, and the UI/UX designer to ensure alignment with the Design System Architecture, User Roles and Permissions definitions, and the list of Supported Devices and Platforms. The design should also take into account incorporating AI-driven features that can learn from user behavior and personalize the interface over time. Include detailed wireframes, mockups, and prototypes in your design proposal to facilitate clear communication with team members. Also, consider implementing feedback mechanisms for continuous improvement of the UI/UX, and conduct usability testing to validate the design. If possible, incorporate AI-driven feedback mechanisms that can learn from user interactions to improve the interface over time. Include these changes in the detailed wireframes, mockups, and prototypes. Update the design proposal with these changes and resubmit for review once ready. During the review process, be open to constructive feedback and iterate on the design as necessary. Once the design is approved, ensure that the UI/UX designer provides the final designs in a format suitable for handoff to frontend developers. \n\n**Additional suggestions:** \n1. Clearly define the scope of the user interface design within the project context (e.g., mobile app, web app, smart home appliances, etc.).\n2. Consider integrating the latest AI-driven trends in UI/UX design to enhance user experience.\n3. Include a timeline for each phase of the design process, from initial sketches to final approval and handoff. In this updated version, also include milestones for key deliverables like wireframes, mockups, prototypes, usability testing, and feedback mechanisms implementation. \n4. Consider breaking down the task into smaller subtasks for better tracking and progress visualization.\n5. Encourage the UI/UX designer to create design system components that are reusable across different parts of the application.",

Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for managing permissions within the ecosystem, using a combination of static roles and dynamic roles based on user behavior for flexible management. Incorporate user activity monitoring for more effective risk assessment. For security audits, consider using open-source tools such as OWASP ZAP or Nessus for thorough testing, and also implement regular automatic scanning. Update the security architecture design before proceeding with the implementation. When making any updates to the RBAC system or user activity monitoring, ensure they are well documented. For clarity, outline specific security measures related to GDPR and CCPA compliance. Suggest potential improvements in the areas of user authentication and authorization, especially considering biometric authentication methods such as facial recognition or voice recognition.
