Consider scalability, maintainability, modularity, performance optimizations, error handling, security aspects, and edge cases. Incorporate fault tolerance, monitoring, and logging mechanisms. Define APIs and necessary integrations with third-party services. Address real-time processing, data privacy, ethical implications of AI-driven research insights, and potential solutions. Ensure that the design patterns used are clearly specified (e.g., Module and Service Locator). Update this RFC with any additional details or specifics as needed.",
