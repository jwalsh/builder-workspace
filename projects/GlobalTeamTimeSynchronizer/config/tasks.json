    "description": "Design the overall architecture of the GlobalTeamTimeSynchronizer system, including components, data flow, integration points, scalability considerations, performance optimizations, security measures, and maintainability best practices. The design should be modular for easy extension and maintenance, taking into account edge cases, error handling mechanisms, and potential performance bottlenecks. Strategies to handle conflicts due to time zone differences should focus on the use of decentralized systems or strategically located servers (consider using a combination of Edge Computing and Microservices Architecture). For large data volumes, a multi-tiered approach is recommended with sharding for horizontal scalability. Suggestions for real-time collaboration tools, APIs, and data storage solutions that accommodate global usage are required. Documentation detailing the system's architecture, components, and their interactions should be provided (Consider using Architecture Diagrams like UML or ArchiMate). In addition to the original requirements, consider implementing a robust monitoring and logging system for performance analysis and troubleshooting (consider using ELK Stack or Prometheus), real-time alerting systems, and automated health checks. Also, outline the planned approach for handling data privacy and security concerns in a globally distributed system (Consider using Zero Trust Architecture and encryption at rest). For the design to be ready for implementation, it should include detailed specifications of each component with their required resources and interfaces. The design should also account for potential future integrations with other systems. If possible, provide an initial timeline for the completion of each phase of the design process.",
