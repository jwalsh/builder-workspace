    "description": "Design the overall architecture of the GlobalTeamTimeSynchronizer system, including components, data flow, integration points, scalability considerations, performance optimizations, security measures, and maintainability best practices. The design should be modular for easy extension and maintenance, taking into account edge cases, error handling mechanisms, and potential performance bottlenecks. Strategies to handle conflicts due to time zone differences should focus on the use of decentralized systems or strategically located servers. For large data volumes, a multi-tiered approach is recommended. Suggestions for real-time collaboration tools, APIs, and data storage solutions that accommodate global usage are required. Documentation detailing the system's architecture, components, and their interactions should be provided. In addition to the original requirements, consider implementing a robust monitoring and logging system for performance analysis and troubleshooting. Also, outline the planned approach for handling data privacy and security concerns in a globally distributed system.",
