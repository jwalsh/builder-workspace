Consider existing solutions in related fields (e.g., simulation and modeling for other complex systems) as inspiration or reference points. Incorporate modularity principles to facilitate future upgrades and expansions, and ensure adherence to best practices in software engineering. Also, provide detailed documentation for each module, including design diagrams and code comments.",
