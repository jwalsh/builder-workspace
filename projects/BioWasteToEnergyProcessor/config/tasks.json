Consider edge cases, error handling, and monitoring/logging mechanisms. Provide detailed diagrams and documentation for easier understanding, and ensure the design is future-proof by considering potential technological advancements. To improve clarity, it would be beneficial to break down the system into subsystems with specific responsibilities. Also, consider incorporating microservices architecture for better scalability and modularity. Lastly, include a section on disaster recovery and system resilience.",

The system should handle large volumes of data from various sources (sensors, IoT devices, external data feeds) and provide real-time analytics and reporting capabilities for monitoring system performance and optimizing the waste-to-energy conversion process. Consider using cloud solutions such as AWS or Google Cloud for data storage and processing. Implement appropriate security measures to protect sensitive data. To ensure scalability and performance, prioritize a modular design with clear interfaces between components. This RFC is open for feedback and suggestions for improvement. Once approved, the task can be further decomposed.",

Additionally, consider implementing a logging and monitoring system for real-time threat detection and response, and incorporate guidelines for data retention and disposal policies. Implementing a centralized identity and access management system will also be essential. For the logging and monitoring system, specify the threshold values for alert generation based on data anomalies. Lastly, ensure that the implemented solutions are compliant with relevant regulatory requirements such as GDPR or HIPAA.",
