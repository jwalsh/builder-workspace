    "description": "Gather and document detailed requirements for the FraudBuster project, including: input data sources (transactional data, user behavior data, third-party APIs), fraud detection rules, machine learning models (with a focus on anomaly detection algorithms such as Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, etc., consider using ensemble methods to improve overall performance), performance targets (latency, throughput, accuracy), integration with existing systems (APIs, databases), and documentation of all implemented components. Also, ensure the design accounts for scalability, security aspects (incorporate encryption, access controls, and auditing mechanisms), and consider future growth by designing components to be easily upgradable or replaceable. Lastly, provide a clear plan for testing and validation to ensure the system's reliability.",
