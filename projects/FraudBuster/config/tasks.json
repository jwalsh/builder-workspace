    "description": "Gather and document detailed requirements for the FraudBuster project, including: input data sources (transactional data, user behavior data, third-party APIs), fraud detection rules, machine learning models (with a focus on anomaly detection algorithms such as Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, etc., consider using ensemble methods to improve overall performance and explore other state-of-the-art techniques like autoencoders or LSTM networks), performance targets (latency, throughput, accuracy), integration with existing systems (APIs, databases), security aspects (incorporate encryption, access controls, auditing mechanisms, and perform a thorough security review to identify any potential vulnerabilities), scalability considerations (ensure the design is modular, horizontally scalable, and able to handle large volumes of data), future growth design principles (design components to be easily upgradable or replaceable, and implement a clear migration path), and a comprehensive plan for testing and validation to ensure system reliability, including unit tests, integration tests, and performance benchmarking. Additionally, consider incorporating real-time monitoring and alerting mechanisms. Finally, provide detailed documentation of all implemented components, ensuring clarity and ease of understanding. Collaborate with relevant team members (task-decomposer, project-manager, frontend-developer, backend-developer, database-specialist, devops-engineer, qa-tester, security-specialist, technical-writer) throughout the process. Once all requirements are gathered and documented, update this RFC to the 'IN_REVIEW' state, assign it to the project-manager for further review and approval. If necessary, provide a detailed timeline for each stage of the project.",
