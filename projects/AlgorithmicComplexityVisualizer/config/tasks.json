    "description": "Design the overall system architecture, including the front-end, back-end, and data storage components. Define the technology stack and integration points. Consider the following aspects: 1) Front-end: Responsive UI, visualization libraries (e.g., D3.js or Chart.js), algorithm input/output handling, user authentication and authorization (e.g., JSON Web Tokens). 2) Back-end: Algorithm execution (e.g., using Python for its large library of algorithms and Jupyter Notebooks for interactive environments), complexity analysis (e.g., BigO Notation Library), API design (RESTful API), user management and access control (implement Role-Based Access Control, RBAC). 3) Data storage: Algorithm metadata, user data, and roles/permissions (using MongoDB or PostgreSQL for flexible schema). 4) Scalability and performance considerations, including caching (e.g., Redis) and load balancing strategies (e.g., using NGINX or AWS Elastic Load Balancer). 5) Security and access control mechanisms, such as secure communication protocols (HTTPS), encryption at rest, data masking for sensitive information, and OAuth2.0 for third-party API integrations. 6) Deployment and infrastructure considerations, including containerization (Docker), orchestration (Kubernetes), and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines using Jenkins or CircleCI. 7) Monitoring and logging strategies for application health and performance (e.g., ELK Stack or Prometheus). 8) Testing strategies, including unit, integration, and end-to-end testing frameworks (Mocha, Jest, Cypress), as well as emphasizing the need for thorough documentation to support the platform's functionality. 9) Internationalization considerations, ensuring the platform can be easily translated and adapted to different languages. 10) Accessibility considerations to ensure that the platform is usable by people with disabilities.",
