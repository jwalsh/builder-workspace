Consider the following aspects: 1) Front-end: Responsive UI, visualization libraries, algorithm input/output handling, user authentication and authorization. 2) Back-end: Algorithm execution, complexity analysis, API design, user management, and access control. 3) Data storage: Algorithm metadata, user data, and roles/permissions. 4) Scalability and performance considerations, including caching and load balancing strategies. 5) Security and access control mechanisms, such as role-based access control (RBAC) and secure communication protocols. 6) Deployment and infrastructure considerations, including containerization, orchestration, and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. 7) Monitoring and logging strategies for application health and performance. 8) Testing strategies, including unit, integration, and end-to-end testing frameworks.",
