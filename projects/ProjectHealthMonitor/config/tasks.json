    "title": "Define Project Scope and Requirements - RFC REVISED",
    "description": "This RFC proposes a detailed specification for the ProjectHealthMonitor tool. The following refined requirements are suggested: 1) Desired features, including real-time progress tracking (including task completion status, time spent, and priority), team morale indicators (such as sentiment analysis from communication platforms like Slack, Microsoft Teams, and surveys), and bottleneck detection (using machine learning algorithms to identify trends in project workflows). 2) User roles, such as project manager, team member, stakeholder, and team lead. 3) Data sources, like project management tools (e.g., Jira, Asana), communication platforms (Slack, Microsoft Teams), development repositories (GitHub, GitLab), and APIs for additional data collection from other internal and external systems. 4) Integration points with external APIs for real-time data collection, analysis, and visualization. To ensure a comprehensive solution, it is also recommended to include historical project data, user feedback, and performance metrics in the tool's scope. Additionally, consider incorporating data privacy and security measures, such as encryption, access controls, and anonymization techniques. It is also essential to address edge cases, like project cancellations or mergers, and provide mechanisms for smooth transition. To ensure the tool is flexible and scalable, employ microservices architecture and containerization technologies. A few suggestions for potential improvements are: a) Adding a feature for predictive analytics based on past project trends and machine learning models. b) Including real-time alerts for critical issues or bottlenecks c) Ensuring that the tool is customizable to suit different project needs and team preferences. To ensure the tool's quality, consider conducting user testing sessions during its development phase. If the project team agrees with these improvements, please update the rfc_state field to 'READY_FOR_IMPLEMENTATION'.",
