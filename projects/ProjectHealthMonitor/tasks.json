    "description": "This RFC proposes a detailed specification for the ProjectHealthMonitor tool. The following requirements are suggested: 1) Desired features, including real-time progress tracking, team morale indicators, and bottleneck detection. 2) User roles, such as project manager, team member, and stakeholder. 3) Data sources, like project management tools (e.g., Jira, Asana), communication platforms (Slack, Microsoft Teams), and development repositories (GitHub, GitLab). 4) Integration points with external APIs for data collection and analysis. Please review and provide feedback for further refinement.",
