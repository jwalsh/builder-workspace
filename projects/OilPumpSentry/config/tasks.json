Consider scalability, fault tolerance, and performance requirements, focusing on industry-standard tools that are both efficient and reliable. Include a detailed discussion on the integration of real-time inference and near real-time notifications into the system architecture, considering the use of edge computing for low-latency processing. Additionally, provide an overview of the technologies and frameworks to be used for each component.",
