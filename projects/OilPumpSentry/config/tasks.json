    "description": "Design the overall system architecture for OilPumpSentry, focusing on data ingestion, processing, storage, visualization, and security components. Consider scalability, fault tolerance, and performance requirements, focusing on industry-standard tools that are both efficient and reliable. Include a detailed discussion on the integration of real-time inference and near real-time notifications into the system architecture, considering the use of edge computing for low-latency processing. Provide an overview of the technologies and frameworks to be used for each component, emphasizing the need for edge AI and IoT solutions for data collection and analysis, and modern web technologies for visualization and user interface. Additionally, discuss the security measures needed to protect sensitive oil and gas industry data and ensure compliance with relevant regulations. Update the system design periodically based on feedback from stakeholders and evolving technological advancements. Once the design is complete, break down the tasks into smaller, manageable units for implementation.",
