    "description": "This RFC outlines the objectives of the CybersecurityAI project, focusing on the AI's capabilities for autonomous threat detection, threat mitigation, and potential expansion to other cybersecurity tasks. Detailed technical requirements include machine learning algorithms (e.g., anomaly detection, supervised/unsupervised learning), data collection and analysis methods (e.g., data sources, data preprocessing techniques), performance expectations (e.g., latency, accuracy, scalability), system architecture (e.g., microservices, serverless), integration points with existing security systems (APIs or SDKs), and a roadmap for future development that includes continuous learning and adaptation to emerging threats and vulnerabilities. The AI should be designed to learn from previous incidents and improve its predictions over time.",
