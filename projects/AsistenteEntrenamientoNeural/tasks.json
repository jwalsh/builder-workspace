This includes specifying target user groups (e.g., athletes, students, professionals), desirable features (such as personalized training plans, progress tracking, integration with biometric data, gamification elements, real-time feedback mechanisms), performance expectations (e.g., response time under 2 seconds, scalability to accommodate thousands of users, compatibility with various devices and platforms), and any restrictions or limitations (including data privacy, regulatory compliance, accessibility requirements). The completed document will serve as the basis for the project's development. Additionally, consider potential user feedback mechanisms and methods to ensure ongoing improvement of the system.",
