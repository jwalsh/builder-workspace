    "description": "Detailed outline of requirements for the neural training assistant project. This includes identifying target users (e.g., athletes, students, professionals), desired features (e.g., personalized training plans, progress tracking, biometric data integration, gamification elements, real-time feedback mechanisms), performance goals (e.g., response time under 2 seconds, scalability to support thousands of users, compatibility with various devices and platforms), and any constraints or limitations (e.g., data privacy, regulatory compliance, accessibility requirements). The final document will serve as the foundation for the project's development.",
