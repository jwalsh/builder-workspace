    "description": "Detailed specifications for the neural training assistant project. This includes identifying target user segments (e.g., athletes, students, professionals), desired features (such as personalized training plans, progress tracking, integration with biometric data, gamification elements, real-time feedback mechanisms, adaptive learning algorithms, and adaptive learning algorithms), performance expectations (e.g., response time under 2 seconds, scalability to accommodate thousands of users, compatibility with various devices and platforms, robustness, and error tolerance), data privacy considerations (including anonymization techniques, secure data storage, and compliance with relevant regulations), accessibility requirements, and ongoing system improvement mechanisms (such as user feedback collection and implementation of machine learning models for continuous learning). Additionally, address potential technical debt, consider the need for documentation and testing, and perform a feasibility study on the integration of AI and neural stimulation technologies. The completed document will serve as a foundation for the project's development and will guide subsequent tasks. Involve stakeholders in the decision-making process where necessary. Upon completion, this task should be reviewed by the Project Manager before moving forward to implementation.",
