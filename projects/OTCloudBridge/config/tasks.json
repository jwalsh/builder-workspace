    "description": "Gather and document the detailed requirements for the OTCloudBridge project, including specific operational technology data centers to be integrated (e.g., Data Center A, Data Center B), preferred cloud platforms (Amazon Web Services - AWS, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform - GCP) with relevant versions or services (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, GCP Cloud Storage), the types of data to be ingested and analyzed (including specific formats or structures such as OPC UA, MQTT, Modbus, etc.), security and compliance requirements (incorporating standards such as SOC 2, HIPAA, GDPR, NIST SP 800-53, and PCI DSS), data governance policies (data retention, access controls, data privacy, etc.), scalability and performance requirements (with potential use cases, response times, and throughput expectations), disaster recovery plans (RTO, RPO, backup strategies), monitoring and alerting strategies (using tools like Nagios, Grafana, Prometheus), and any other relevant constraints and considerations. Engage relevant stakeholders such as operational technology experts, cloud architects, security specialists, data analysts, data engineers, and data scientists to ensure comprehensive requirements gathering and validation. Also, include the expected timeline for each phase of the project and identify potential risks and mitigation strategies. Break down this task into smaller subtasks if necessary for better management. Provide a clear distinction between functional requirements (what the system must do) and non-functional requirements (how the system should perform). Once completed, update the task status to 'DONE' and assign it to the project manager for review and validation.",

The updated design includes components and services required for secure data transfer, ingestion, storage, and analysis. The revision addresses aspects such as data security, scalability, fault tolerance, monitoring, logging, performance optimization, and compliance with industry standards. Integration points with operational technology data centers and cloud platforms are considered, ensuring seamless interoperability and high-performance data handling. Additionally, the design takes into account the need for encryption, access control mechanisms, and the use of modern authentication protocols. The design also includes a detailed plan for testing and validation, which now includes stress tests, load tests, and security audits to ensure the system's reliability, performance, and security. Furthermore, the document will be updated with diagrams and flowcharts to enhance understanding.",
