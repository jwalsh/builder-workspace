Also, specify the necessary data security and privacy measures, error handling mechanisms, disaster recovery plan, and consider potential use cases, edge cases, and limitations. Additionally, outline the project's performance metrics for measuring success, and define the system's interface requirements (e.g., UI/UX design). Lastly, involve stakeholders in the discussion to ensure all necessary requirements are captured.",

    "description": "Design the overall system architecture for the Automated Financial Auditing project. Focus on a modular and scalable design that includes components for data ingestion, processing, analysis, reporting, and security. Ensure performance, fault tolerance, and regulatory compliance requirements are considered. Clearly define data flows, interfaces, and integration points, emphasizing maintainability and extensibility. Include error handling mechanisms to ensure robustness. The architecture design should consider the following: \n1. Data ingestion methods (API, file upload, real-time feeds) \n2. Data processing techniques (batch processing, streaming) \n3. Analysis methods (statistical analysis, machine learning models) \n4. Reporting features (real-time dashboards, periodic reports, export options) \n5. Security measures (encryption, access controls, auditing) \n6. Scalability solutions (horizontally and vertically scalable architectures) \n7. Load balancing strategies for high traffic periods. Additionally, consider the following: \n8. Data storage and retrieval strategies \n9. Monitoring and logging mechanisms \n10. Disaster recovery plan. To ensure the RFC is actionable, provide detailed specifications for each component, such as preferred technologies, APIs, and libraries. The architecture design should be flexible to accommodate future enhancements and changes. Once the design is complete, conduct a thorough review and testing to validate its effectiveness. If necessary, iterate on the design based on feedback from the team and stakeholders. Finally, update the rfc_state field to 'READY_FOR_ACTION' if the design meets all the requirements.\n\nUpdated fields: \n- The task is now assigned to the code-architect as per your role.\n- The rfc_state is updated to 'READY_FOR_ACTION'.",
