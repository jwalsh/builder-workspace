    "description": "Design the overall system architecture for the Automated Financial Auditing project. Focus on a modular and scalable design that includes components for data ingestion, processing, analysis, reporting, and security. Ensure performance, fault tolerance, and regulatory compliance requirements are considered. Clearly define data flows, interfaces, and integration points, emphasizing maintainability and extensibility. Include error handling mechanisms to ensure robustness. The architecture design should consider the following: \n1. Data ingestion methods (API, file upload, real-time feeds) \n2. Data processing techniques (batch processing, streaming) \n3. Analysis methods (statistical analysis, machine learning models) \n4. Reporting features (real-time dashboards, periodic reports, export options) \n5. Security measures (encryption, access controls, auditing) \n6. Scalability solutions (horizontally and vertically scalable architectures) \n7. Load balancing strategies for high traffic periods.",
