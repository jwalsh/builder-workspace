This design will address real-time processing needs, power management, modularity for easy integration of new robot types, and will specify any necessary API documentation. To ensure comprehensive understanding, the design will provide detailed explanations on how these elements will interact, considering the need for seamless collaboration among various components. Additionally, the revised design will outline strategies to improve the system's responsiveness, optimize resource allocation, and minimize potential bottlenecks.",

Implement support for data ingestion, querying, archiving, and real-time streaming. Ensure strong data security and access controls are in place while adhering to the principles of least privilege and need-to-know. Additionally, consider implementing data compression and efficient indexing strategies to optimize storage usage and retrieval times. Also, ensure compatibility with popular big data processing frameworks (e.g., Apache Spark, Hadoop) for further analysis.\nAdditionaly, escape newlines in the description field as \\n.\\n",
