    "description": "Revised design of the overall system architecture for the advanced global text analysis platform. The revised architecture includes components, data flow, integration points, and considerations for scalability, maintainability, performance, multi-language support, error handling, edge cases, AI techniques for processing and analyzing documents. This design also improves areas such as system resilience, security, accessibility, usability for non-technical users, and compatibility with various programming languages. The microservices-based approach ensures scalability and maintainability, following principles of decoupling and separation of concerns. Additionally, the design emphasizes modularity, ease of integration with external services, and focuses on feedback from previous reviews, addressing concerns related to system architecture flexibility and extensibility. It is important to note that this RFC assumes that the 'Define Project Scope and Requirements' task has been completed. The revised design will be further refined based on the suggestions and feedback received during this review process. (Please refer to the updated 'review_comments' field for specific comments and suggestions.)",

    "description": "Design and implement a scalable, efficient, and secure data storage and management solution. This will involve leveraging a combination of relational databases (e.g., PostgreSQL for structured data) and NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB or Cassandra for unstructured or semi-structured data), based on the project's specific data requirements. Implement caching mechanisms (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed data to improve performance, focusing on LRU, ARC, or other cache eviction strategies. To ensure data security, utilize encryption at rest and in transit, implement robust backup strategies (daily snapshots, transaction logs) to maintain data integrity, and enforce least privilege principles. Implement read/write replication, sharding, and partitioning for scalability. Performance testing will be conducted under expected loads using load testing tools, and system monitoring will be set up with tools like Prometheus or Grafana for real-time insights. Upon completion of the design phase, perform a thorough code review before moving to the next stages. The choice of specific technologies should be discussed in the 'Design System Architecture' task, which this task depends on. Once the 'Design System Architecture' task is approved and completed, assign the 'task-decomposer' to decompose the task into smaller, manageable tasks and start the implementation process. Performance testing and system monitoring will be conducted concurrently with the implementation. Note that while the RFC has been reviewed and found ready for the next state, it would be beneficial to clarify any specific performance or security requirements that should be prioritized in the data storage and management solution, and to specify the performance benchmarks that will be used to measure the success of this task.",

Ensure the platform's compliance with relevant regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS. Additionally, implement data protection best practices such as data minimization, pseudonymization, secure data deletion, and privacy by design principles. Suggest using a third-party service for managing user identities to improve security and reduce overhead. Consider adding a feature to allow users to request data erasure in compliance with GDPR's 'Right to be Forgotten'. For the data erasure feature, it might be beneficial to also include an option for users to download their own data. Lastly, consider providing detailed documentation on all security measures implemented and how they are used within the platform.",

Break down the task into smaller, manageable sub-tasks for better tracking and execution.\n2. Collaborate with frontend and backend developers by assigning tasks specifically to 'frontend-developer' and 'backend-developer' fields.\n3. Work closely with the security specialist and ensure their involvement in CI/CD setup, assign this task to 'security-specialist' field.\n4. Ensure proper documentation of the pipeline for future reference and maintenance, assign this task to 'technical-writer' field.\n5. Include automated tests for UI elements and add 'frontend-developer' as a collaborator for this task.\n6. Add 'project-manager' as a reviewer before moving to the next state.\n7. Update dependencies to include all necessary tasks, for example 'Design System Architecture', 'Code Linting Configuration', 'Unit Testing Framework Selection' etc.\n8.
