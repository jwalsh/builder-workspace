Implement caching mechanisms (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed data to improve performance, focusing on LRU, ARC, or other cache eviction strategies. Ensure the use of encryption at rest and in transit, and implement robust backup strategies (e.g., daily snapshots, transaction logs) to maintain data integrity. Consider implementing read/write replication, sharding, and partitioning for scalability.",
