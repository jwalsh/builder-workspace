    "description": "Revised design of the overall system architecture for the advanced global text analysis platform. The revised architecture includes components, data flow, integration points, and considerations for scalability, maintainability, performance, multi-language support, error handling, edge cases, AI techniques for processing and analyzing documents. This design also includes improvements in areas such as system resilience, security, accessibility, and additional emphasis on the platform's usability for non-technical users. The revised architecture addresses feedback from previous reviews, focusing on modularity, ease of integration with external services, and compatibility with various programming languages. Furthermore, this RFC proposes a microservices-based approach to ensure scalability and maintainability, adhering to the principles of decoupling and separation of concerns.",

This will involve leveraging a combination of relational databases (e.g., PostgreSQL for structured data) and NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB or Cassandra for unstructured or semi-structured data), based on the project's specific data requirements. Implement caching mechanisms (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed data to improve performance, focusing on LRU, ARC, or other cache eviction strategies. To ensure data security, utilize encryption at rest and in transit, and implement robust backup strategies (daily snapshots, transaction logs) to maintain data integrity. Consider implementing read/write replication, sharding, and partitioning for scalability. Performance testing will be conducted under expected loads using load testing tools, and system monitoring will be set up with tools like Prometheus or Grafana for real-time insights. Upon completion of the design phase, perform a thorough code review before moving to the next stages. **Note that the choice of specific technologies should be discussed in the 'Design System Architecture' task, which this task depends on.** Once the 'Design System Architecture' task is approved and completed, assign the 'task-decomposer' or 'database-specialist' to decompose the task into smaller, manageable tasks and start the implementation process. Performance testing and system monitoring will be conducted concurrently with the implementation. **Update:** The RFC is now ready for the next state: 'approved'.",

Additionally, implement data protection best practices such as data minimization, pseudonymization, secure data deletion, and privacy by design principles. Suggest using a third-party service for managing user identities to improve security and reduce overhead. Lastly, consider adding a feature to allow users to request data erasure in compliance with GDPR's 'Right to be Forgotten'.",

The pipeline should be configured to automatically trigger on code changes and support rollbacks in case of deployment failures.\n\nTo ensure a smooth flow, consider the following suggestions:\n1. Break down the task into smaller, manageable sub-tasks for better tracking and execution (assign to task-decomposer for further decomposition).\n2. Collaborate with the frontend and backend developers by assigning tasks specifically to frontend-developer and backend-developer fields.\n3. Work closely with the security specialist and ensure their involvement in CI/CD setup (assign to security-specialist field).\n4. Ensure proper documentation of the pipeline for future reference and maintenance, this can be done by assigning the task to technical-writer field.\n5. Include automated tests for UI elements and add frontend-developer as a collaborator for this task.\n6. Add the project manager as a reviewer before moving to the next state.",
