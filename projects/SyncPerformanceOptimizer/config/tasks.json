    "description": "Design the overall system architecture for the SyncPerformanceOptimizer, including components, data flows, interfaces, and integration points required to analyze and optimize data synchronization processes across different data sources and targets. The design should emphasize scalability, performance optimization, and compatibility with various platforms while incorporating best practices in concurrency control, error handling, and logging. A modular design approach is recommended for easy maintenance and extensibility. Additional considerations include ensuring the system can handle large volumes of data, is resilient to failures, and provides monitoring and reporting capabilities. The design should also provide clear APIs for integration with other systems.",
