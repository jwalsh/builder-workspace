    "description": "Design the overall system architecture for SecureFileShare, including components, interfaces, data flow, security considerations, and scalability. The architecture will incorporate a front-end interface for users to upload/download files (with progressive enhancement for SFTP, FTP, and FTPS), a back-end server to handle file transfers, a malware detection engine, a database for metadata and user storage, and a secure storage system for files. This design will leverage microservices architecture to ensure scalability and maintainability. Proper authentication, authorization, and encryption mechanisms will be implemented for secure file transfers. Potential performance bottlenecks are addressed and recommendations for load balancing and caching strategies are provided, including the use of content delivery networks (CDNs) and opcode caches. Additional considerations include the integration of SFTP, FTP, and FTPS protocols within business-to-business workflows, as well as the implementation of webhooks for real-time notifications. The design will also prioritize the use of open-source libraries for maximum compatibility and flexibility.",

    "description": "Design the security architecture, perform threat modeling to identify potential vulnerabilities, and document these findings. The security architecture should cover encryption (AES-256), authentication using OAuth or SSH keys, access control based on role-based access control (RBAC) and least privilege principle, secure communication protocols such as SFTP, FTPS, and TLS 1.3, malware detection mechanisms like YARA rules and ClamAV scanning, and implement rate limiting to mitigate Denial of Service attacks. Threat modeling should consider various attack vectors, such as man-in-the-middle attacks, brute-force attacks, malware injection, and denial of service attacks.",
