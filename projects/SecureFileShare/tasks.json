The architecture should include the following components: a front-end interface for users to upload/download files, a back-end server to handle file transfers, a malware detection engine, a database to store file metadata and user information, and a secure storage system for files. Consider using microservices architecture for better scalability and maintainability. Ensure proper authentication, authorization, and encryption mechanisms are in place for secure file transfers. Address potential performance bottlenecks and provide recommendations for load balancing and caching strategies.",
