    "description": "Design the overall system architecture for the BetHedge sports betting application. The design should include:\n1. Edge computing infrastructure for improved performance.\n2. Components addressing regulatory requirements, with a focus on ensuring compliance with relevant data protection laws.\n3. Data storage and security measures, emphasizing scalability during peak events, performance optimizations such as caching, lazy loading, and minimizing HTTP requests, and robust backup and recovery strategies for disaster recovery purposes.\n4. Integration of third-party services (e.g., payment gateways, identity verification), with a strong focus on secure API design, authentication methods, and handling potential service outages gracefully.\n5. Clear separation of concerns between the frontend, backend, and edge components using well-defined APIs and interfaces, ensuring smooth communication and minimal dependency conflicts.\n6. Modularity and maintainability guidelines, ensuring that each component can be updated or replaced independently, with consideration given to future scalability and extensibility.\n7. Error handling, edge cases, and performance optimizations considerations, including fallback mechanisms and graceful degradation strategies in case of service outages or high traffic periods.\n8. Comprehensive documentation in a clear, concise technical writing style, with examples and visual aids where appropriate, ensuring that the design is easily understood by developers, QA testers, and other relevant stakeholders.\n9. Review of the design with relevant stakeholders and incorporation of their feedback.\n10. Additional emphasis on identifying potential bottlenecks or areas of concern in the proposed architecture and proposing solutions to address them, including load balancing strategies for high-traffic regions.\n11. Collaborate with the devops engineer and security specialist to ensure seamless deployment and continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline, as well as ongoing monitoring of security vulnerabilities and compliance requirements.\n12. Provide guidance on choosing appropriate technologies for each component, ensuring that they are scalable, performant, and secure.\n13. Address any potential scalability concerns in the design, considering factors such as regional distribution of users, time-sensitive data, and event-driven architecture.",
