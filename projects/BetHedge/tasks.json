Components addressing regulatory requirements.\n3. Data storage and security measures, with emphasis on compliance with relevant data protection laws.\n4. Scalability considerations, including strategies for handling increased user load during peak events.\n5. Performance optimizations, such as caching, lazy loading, and minimizing HTTP requests.\n6. Integration of third-party services (e.g., payment gateways, identity verification), with a focus on API design and secure authentication methods.\n7. Clear separation of concerns between the frontend, backend, and edge components, using well-defined APIs and interfaces.\n8. Modularity and maintainability guidelines, ensuring that each component can be updated or replaced independently.\n9. Error handling, edge cases, and performance optimizations considerations, including fallback mechanisms and graceful degradation strategies.\n10. Comprehensive documentation in a clear, concise technical writing style, with examples and visual aids where appropriate.\n11. Review of the design with relevant stakeholders and incorporation of their feedback.",
