Consider data encryption (AES-256), access controls (Role-Based Access Control), compliance with relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA, PCI-DSS), and privacy by design principles. Ensure scalability, high availability, performance optimization for handling large volumes of data and concurrent requests, and data partitioning/sharding strategies using horizontally-partitioned shards and vertical partitioning for large tables. Define data retention policies based on regulatory requirements and industry best practices, and implement archiving/purging mechanisms to manage long-term storage. Incorporate audit logging and monitoring capabilities using tools like ELK Stack or Splunk for real-time analysis and alerting. Update the task when the database design is complete, including ER diagrams and SQL scripts, and provide a clear handoff plan for development.",
