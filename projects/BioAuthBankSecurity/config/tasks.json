    "description": "Design the overall system architecture, including components, interfaces, and data flow. This task encompasses the following aspects: 1) Modular design for scalability and maintainability, 2) Secure data handling and storage, including encryption and access controls, with emphasis on compliance with relevant security and privacy regulations such as GDPR, PCI-DSS, and other banking standards (e.g., SWIFT, ISO 20022), ensuring that the design follows best practices for these regulations throughout the development process, 3) High availability and fault tolerance, with redundancy and failover mechanisms, ensuring performance optimization for real-time biometric processing, including load balancing and caching strategies using distributed caching systems like Redis or Memcached, considering adding a CDN for edge caching to improve response times, 4) Integration with existing banking systems through secure APIs and data exchange protocols (consider adopting industry standards), ensuring that the integration is bidirectional and supports both read and write operations, 5) Performance monitoring and logging systems for security and performance analysis, collaborating with the task-decomposer to break down this task into smaller subtasks that can be assigned efficiently, 6) Implement a robust authentication mechanism that guarantees secure access to the system, considering multi-factor biometrics (fingerprint, facial recognition, and behavioral biometrics), ensuring that the implementation follows best practices for security and privacy throughout the development process, with an emphasis on passwordless authentication, 7) Collaborate with the team to ensure compliance with relevant industry standards and regulations throughout the development process, including regular security audits and penetration testing. The RFC has been reviewed, and it is suggested that the task-decomposer breaks down this task into smaller subtasks for efficient assignment.",

Consider data encryption (AES-256), access controls (Role-Based Access Control), compliance with relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA, PCI-DSS), and privacy by design principles. Ensure scalability, high availability, performance optimization for handling large volumes of data and concurrent requests, and data partitioning/sharding strategies using horizontally-partitioned shards and vertical partitioning for large tables. Define data retention policies based on regulatory requirements and industry best practices, and implement archiving/purging mechanisms to manage long-term storage. Incorporate audit logging and monitoring capabilities using tools like ELK Stack or Splunk for real-time analysis and alerting. Update the task when the database design is complete, including ER diagrams and SQL scripts, and provide a clear handoff plan for development. To ensure thoroughness, also consider integrating anomaly detection systems to flag potential security threats, and implement a disaster recovery plan. Once these aspects are addressed, update the task status to 'COMPLETE' and assign it to the database-specialist or devops-engineer for implementation.",
