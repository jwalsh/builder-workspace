This will include creating detailed user stories, wireframes, technical specifications, and development roadmap for each feature. The documentation should cover desired features, target audience, technical specifications, performance goals, audio file formats, real-time processing capabilities, integration with existing digital audio workstations (DAWs), compatibility with various operating systems and hardware configurations, requirements for the AI model training process (data sources, model deployment strategies), user interface design considerations (accessibility, potential collaborative features), and a process for gathering and evaluating user feedback during the development cycle.\n\nTask decomposition is recommended to break down this task into smaller, manageable pieces. This will include creating detailed user stories, wireframes, technical specifications, and development roadmap for each feature. Additionally, establish a timeline for completion of these tasks.",
