This includes the AR rendering engine, content management system, user interface, and data storage. Consider scalability, performance, security, maintainability, and accessibility. Define the high-level components, their responsibilities, and interactions. Also, outline the integration with existing educational platforms, if applicable, and ensure compatibility with assistive technologies for diverse learners. This design also includes a modular structure to facilitate future updates and improvements. Include mockups or diagrams where appropriate. Define any required APIs and documentation for developers.",
