    "description": "Revised design of the overall system architecture for the Augmented Reality Education project. This includes the AR rendering engine, content management system, user interface, and data storage. The design aims to optimize scalability, performance, security, maintainability, accessibility, and usability. Detailed specifications of components, their responsibilities, and interactions are provided. Integration with existing educational platforms is considered, ensuring compatibility with assistive technologies for diverse learners. A modular structure is adopted to facilitate future updates and improvements. Mockups or diagrams are included where appropriate. Required APIs and documentation for developers are defined. User roles and permissions, data privacy considerations, error handling mechanisms, performance optimization strategies, and accessibility guidelines are detailed. In case of any dependencies on other tasks or RFCs, they are listed explicitly. A timeline for task completion is suggested. Please review the document thoroughly, and suggest any necessary changes or improvements. If there are no major issues, I recommend moving this RFC to 'READY_FOR_IMPLEMENTATION'.",

    "description": "Create an intuitive, engaging, visually appealing, accessible, and easy-to-navigate user interface for students and educators. The UI should be optimized for different device types (smartphones, tablets, AR headsets) and incorporate gamification elements to enhance the learning experience. To achieve this, collaboration between UX/UI designers, frontend developers, accessibility experts, game designers, educational consultants, cognitive psychologists (for learning effectiveness), and a dedicated team of user testing specialists (for iterative improvements based on feedback) is recommended. Ensure accessibility features are implemented to cater to users with disabilities. Upon completion of the design phase, conduct usability testing, iterate as necessary, and make any adjustments suggested by testers. This task depends on 'Design AR Learning Platform Architecture' and should be prioritized appropriately. Once the design phase is complete, assign the task to a frontend-developer for implementation. Upon completion of implementation, assign the task to the QA-tester for testing. If any issues are found during testing, the task will be reassigned back to the frontend-developer for resolution. This RFC has been APPROVED and is now ready for further decomposition into tasks.",
