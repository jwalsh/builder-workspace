The architecture should consider scalability, maintainability, modularity, and address potential performance bottlenecks, error handling, security concerns, sustainability aspects (e.g., energy efficiency and waste minimization), and include an emphasis on resilience to ensure the system remains operational in adverse conditions. Provide design documentation detailing the proposed system structure, interfaces, and communication protocols, along with a disaster recovery plan, focusing on clear and concise explanations for each component and their relationships. Suggest strategies for continuous improvement and integration of new technologies as they become available, emphasizing the importance of modularity to facilitate such updates. Include a section addressing long-term sustainability considerations, such as upgradeability, maintainability, and recyclability. Consider the potential need for AI/ML integration to optimize drilling processes and reduce carbon emissions. Upon completion, provide a presentation of the proposed architecture to the team for feedback and final approval.",
