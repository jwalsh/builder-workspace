    "description": "Define project scope, goals, and requirements. Conduct market research, gather user feedback, and analyze existing documentation tools. Identify target audience, use cases, and key features. Determine technology stack and integration requirements. Establish project timeline, milestones, and resource allocation. This task may also involve creating a comprehensive project plan, documentation, and specifications for each identified feature. Once the planning phase is complete, the task will be decomposed into smaller tasks for further implementation. Include competitive analysis to understand market landscape and positioning. Furthermore, it's recommended to conduct a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analysis to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the project context. Suggestions: Add a section for risk management and mitigation strategies, and consider involving the UX/UI designer early in the process to ensure user-friendly design.",
