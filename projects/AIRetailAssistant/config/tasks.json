Define the data flow between components, integration points with external systems (e.g., payment gateways, shipping providers, third-party AI services), and scalability considerations. Ensure adherence to best practices for maintainability, modularity, security, and performance optimization. Consider using microservices architecture and event-driven architecture for better scalability and decoupling. Incorporate feedback from the team to improve the system design, ensure it is future-proof, and investigate the use of containerization technologies (like Docker) for increased portability and easier deployment. Update the task status to 'IMPLEMENTATION_IN_PROGRESS' as the design is now ready for implementation. To further enhance the design, also consider integrating real-time analytics and A/B testing capabilities, and exploring edge computing for improved performance and reduced latency.",
