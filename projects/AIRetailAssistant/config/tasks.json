Define the data flow between components, integration points with external systems (e.g., payment gateways, shipping providers, third-party AI services), and scalability considerations. Ensure adherence to best practices for maintainability, modularity, security, and performance optimization. Consider using microservices architecture and event-driven architecture for better scalability and decoupling. Incorporate feedback from the team to improve the system design, ensure it is future-proof, and investigate the use of containerization technologies (like Docker) for increased portability and easier deployment. Update the task status to 'IMPLEMENTATION_IN_PROGRESS' as the design is now ready for implementation. To further enhance the design, also consider integrating real-time analytics and A/B testing capabilities, exploring edge computing for improved performance and reduced latency, and implementing a modular approach for better maintainability and scalability. Include provisions for monitoring and logging, to facilitate troubleshooting and system optimization. Consider using Agile methodologies to ensure continuous improvement and rapid response to feedback and changing requirements. Update the 'assigned_to' field to 'backend-developer' for initial implementation of the design.",
