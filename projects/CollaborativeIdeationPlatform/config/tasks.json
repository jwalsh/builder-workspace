    "description": "Develop the user authentication and authorization mechanisms by integrating with existing identity providers (e.g., Active Directory, LDAP, OAuth providers) and role-based access control (RBAC). Ensure compliance with industry-standard security practices and data protection regulations. Implement mechanisms for user registration, password management, multi-factor authentication, and session management using token-based authentication (e.g., JWT) for stateless authentication and authorization. Provide a flexible and extensible authorization model to support different levels of access and permissions based on user roles and responsibilities. Consider implementing token refresh mechanisms for long-lived tokens, such as the sliding window approach to minimize token exposure duration (e.g., 15 minutes). Enhance security by incorporating measures like rate limiting and account lockout to prevent brute force attacks. For the token refresh mechanism, consider using a sliding window approach with an appropriate time frame, such as 15 minutes. Ensure that the solution adheres to best practices for input validation, output encoding, and protection against common web vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, CSRF, SQL injection). Update the user interface for registration, password management, and other authentication-related features. Update the task dependencies by including 'Session Management' in addition to 'Design System Architecture'. Incorporate measures like input validation, output encoding, and protection against common web vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, CSRF, SQL injection) into the user interface updates.",
