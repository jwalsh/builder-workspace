    "description": "Develop the user authentication and authorization mechanisms by integrating with existing identity providers (e.g., Active Directory, LDAP, OAuth providers) and role-based access control (RBAC). Ensure compliance with industry-standard security practices and data protection regulations. Implement mechanisms for user registration, password management, multi-factor authentication, and session management using token-based authentication (e.g., JWT) for stateless authentication and authorization. Provide a flexible and extensible authorization model to support different levels of access and permissions based on user roles and responsibilities. Consider implementing token refresh mechanisms for long-lived tokens. Implement appropriate security measures such as input validation, output encoding, and protection against common web vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, CSRF, SQL injection). In addition, ensure that the solution is scalable to handle a large number of users and requests. Update the user interface for registration, password management, and other authentication-related features.",
