    "description": "This RFC proposes a revised and expanded version of the requirements for the GoalCascadeVisualizer. The update includes detailed user stories, use cases, functional specifications, non-functional requirements (performance, security, scalability, etc.), data models, wireframes, and interaction design details. Ambiguities are clarified, success metrics are defined, a focus on responsive design for mobile and desktop platforms is added, and a comprehensive testing plan is outlined to ensure the tool's effectiveness. The task requires the review of all provided material to ensure alignment with project goals, and suggests a further exploration of potential integration points with other existing tools in our ecosystem. The task requires the input from multiple team members including frontend-developer, backend-developer, database-specialist, devops-engineer, qa-tester, security-specialist, and technical-writer. Upon review, please provide any necessary feedback or suggestions for improvement. If the RFC is ready for the next state, update the rfc_state field accordingly.",
