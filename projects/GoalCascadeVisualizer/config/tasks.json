    "description": "This RFC proposes a revised and expanded version of the requirements for the GoalCascadeVisualizer. The update includes detailed user stories, use cases, functional specifications, non-functional requirements (performance, security, scalability, etc.), data models, wireframes, and interaction design details. Ambiguities are clarified, success metrics are defined, a focus on responsive design for mobile and desktop platforms is added, a comprehensive testing plan is outlined to ensure the tool's effectiveness, and potential integration points with other existing tools in our ecosystem are explored. The task requires the review of all provided material to ensure alignment with project goals. It suggests that upon review, necessary feedback or suggestions for improvement should be provided by the code-architect, frontend-developer, backend-developer, database-specialist, devops-engineer, qa-tester, security-specialist, and technical-writer. If the RFC is ready for the next state, update the rfc_state field accordingly to 'READY_FOR_IMPLEMENTATION' and assign it to the task-decomposer for further action.",
