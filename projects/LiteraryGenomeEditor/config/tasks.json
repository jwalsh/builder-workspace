    "description": "Clearly outline the functional and non-functional requirements for the LiteraryGenomeEditor. This includes desired features, user stories, use cases, performance, scalability, security, maintainability, potential risks, and constraints. The focus should be on creating a tool that allows authors to seamlessly blend elements from different genres or styles, while maintaining the integrity of each source and the resulting literary hybrid.\n1. A user-friendly interface for easy navigation and manipulation of text, with intuitive design and clear labeling to minimize learning curve.\n2. Integration with popular writing software for seamless import/export functionality, supporting a variety of file formats.\n3. Ability to recommend compatible genres or styles based on input text or author preferences, using machine learning techniques such as clustering and collaborative filtering.\n4. Implementing a feedback mechanism for authors to rate and review their literary hybrids, providing valuable insights for future improvements. The feedback system should include options for private comments, public reviews, and rating stars. Additionally, consider implementing an algorithm to automatically generate suggested improvements based on the feedback received.\n5. Compliance with data privacy regulations, ensuring the confidentiality of user's work. This includes secure storage, encryption during transfer, and anonymization where necessary. Consider implementing a two-factor authentication system for added security.\n6. Performance optimization for fast processing times, taking into account the potential large size of input texts. Implement caching mechanisms to improve load times and reduce server strain.\n7. Implementing version control for authors to save, retrieve, compare, and manage different versions of their literary hybrids. Consider providing a visual comparison tool for easy review.\n8. Provide a helpful tutorial or guide for new users to familiarize themselves with the tool, including interactive elements such as pop-up tips and guided tours.\n9. Conduct regular user testing and gather feedback to continuously improve the LiteraryGenomeEditor.\n10. Ensure the LiteraryGenomeEditor is accessible to users of all abilities by adhering to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1.",
