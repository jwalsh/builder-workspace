    "description": "Clearly outline the functional and non-functional requirements for the LiteraryGenomeEditor. This includes desired features, user stories, use cases, performance, scalability, security, maintainability, potential risks, and constraints. The focus should be on creating a tool that allows authors to seamlessly blend elements from different genres or styles, while maintaining the integrity of each source and the resulting literary hybrid. Additionally, the requirements should consider the following: \n1. A user-friendly interface for easy navigation and manipulation of text.\n2. Integration with popular writing software for seamless import/export functionality.\n3. Ability to recommend compatible genres or styles based on input text or author preferences.\n4. Implementing a feedback mechanism for authors to rate and review their literary hybrids, providing valuable insights for future improvements.\n5. Compliance with data privacy regulations, ensuring the confidentiality of user's work.",
