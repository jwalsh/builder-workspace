    "description": "Refine the detailed requirements for the ThreatHuntingPlatform by integrating feedback from relevant stakeholders. Ensure thorough documentation of desired features, functionalities, performance expectations (including response times, scalability, and reliability), security considerations (including data privacy, cybersecurity standards, and threat modeling), compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA), potential integration with existing threat hunting solutions, compatibility with various operating systems, and a roadmap for updates and maintenance. Conduct industry research, analyze best practices, evaluate competitors' offerings, and apply relevant trends to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the project scope. Once complete, collaborate with the team to prioritize and decompose the tasks for implementation. Additionally, consider the scalability and extensibility of the platform, as well as the usability and user experience aspects. Update the task status to REVIEW_PENDING when the documentation is complete and ready for review by the project manager or code architect.",

The system should support ingesting data from various sources, efficient querying and retrieval, data archiving, integration with other components of the platform, and ensure compliance with relevant data privacy and security regulations. The system should also provide mechanisms for real-time data streaming, anomaly detection, and data visualization. Consider optimizing the design to support horizontal scaling, improve performance through caching strategies, and implement data compression techniques to reduce storage costs. Integrate with popular open-source big data processing frameworks like Apache Hadoop or Apache Spark, focusing on Spark Streaming for real-time data processing and Apache Parquet for efficient data storage. Also, consider implementing an event-driven architecture for better scalability and fault tolerance, and use containerization technologies such as Docker for easy deployment and management.",

The pipeline should include stages for linting, static analysis, unit testing, integration testing, and security scanning. Additionally, it should support multiple environments (e.g., development, staging, production) and allow for easy rollbacks if issues arise. To optimize the pipeline's efficiency, consider using popular tools like Jenkins, Travis CI or GitHub Actions. For improved detail, specify the exact tools to be used in each stage of the pipeline (e.g., ESLint for linting, SonarQube for static analysis), and outline the expected outcomes for each tool's application. Also, include a step for documentation generation, preferably using tools like Doxygen or Sphinx.",

This collaboration will involve defining methodologies, tools, and metrics for each type of testing. Update the strategy periodically based on feedback from the testing phase and incorporate any necessary changes. For improved efficiency, consider breaking down this task into smaller sub-tasks, assigning them to appropriate team members (e.g., frontend-developer, backend-developer, database-specialist, devops-engineer, qa-tester), and track their progress. This approach will facilitate parallel work and reduce the overall time taken for testing strategy development.",
