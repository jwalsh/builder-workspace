    "description": "Revised design of the overall system architecture for the Predictive Policing project. This includes data ingestion, processing, modeling, and visualization components, as well as defining the technology stack and integration points. The design adheres to best practices for security, privacy, and ethical considerations in predictive policing systems, while considering the implications of AI-driven decision making on social justice and community safety. The architecture aims to optimize police patrols and resources, while minimizing potential biases or disparities. A plan is included for regular audits and updates to ensure the model's predictions remain accurate and fair over time. Upon completion, a detailed technical document will be prepared by the Technical Writer, with an increased focus on transparency, explainability, and accountability in the system design, as well as ensuring explainable AI principles are followed throughout the design process. Collaboration with UX/UI team may be required to create user-friendly interfaces that allow for easy interpretation of results. Upon review and approval, tasks will be delegated accordingly to frontend-developer, backend-developer, database-specialist, devops-engineer, and qa-tester. Upon completion, the design will undergo a thorough security audit by the Security Specialist before being deployed. It is recommended that the RFC is reviewed by the Project Manager and the Task Decomposer to ensure all necessary aspects are addressed and delegated appropriately.",

Collaboration with the System Architecture Design team, Data Collection and Processing team, Privacy Officer, Ethics Committee, and Legal Department is essential to ensure comprehensive security and privacy measures are implemented. Upon completion of this RFC, a detailed plan will be prepared for implementation, including timelines and responsible parties. The RFC will then move to the 'IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN' state for execution. This task requires priority 1 due to the sensitive nature of the data involved and potential ethical implications. However, it is recommended that the task is reassigned to 'project-manager' for coordination and supervision during the implementation phase.",
