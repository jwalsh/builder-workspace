    "description": "Design the overall system architecture for the Predictive Policing project. This includes data ingestion, processing, modeling, and visualization components, as well as defining the technology stack and integration points. The design should adhere to best practices for security, privacy, and ethical considerations in predictive policing systems, while considering the implications of AI-driven decision making on social justice and community safety. The architecture should aim to optimize police patrols and resources, while minimizing potential biases or disparities. The design should also include a plan for regular audits and updates to ensure the model's predictions remain accurate and fair over time. Upon completion, a detailed technical document will be prepared by the Technical Writer.",
