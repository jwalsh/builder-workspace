This includes both hardware (drone design, navigation, waste collection) and software aspects (autonomous operation, material processing, data management). Also, specify the performance criteria, safety standards, environmental considerations, and potential integration with existing ocean cleanup initiatives. Consider the following areas of focus: hardware robustness for marine environments, energy efficiency in navigation and processing, data security during transmission and storage, and user-friendly interfaces for remote operation and monitoring.",
