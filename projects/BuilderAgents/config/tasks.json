    "description": "Gather and document the project requirements, goals, constraints, and use cases for BuilderAgents. Identify the key stakeholders and their expectations. Define the project's scope, deliverables, and success criteria. Outline the high-level architecture, the roles of the specialized AI agents, and their interrelationships in achieving the project objectives. Ensure that the requirements are clear, measurable, and aligned with the project's objectives. For this task, I suggest adding a section for potential risks and mitigation strategies. Once complete, validate if the requirements align with the overall project vision and objectives. Upon approval, proceed to the next phase of task decomposition.",

This will include defining the roles of different AI agents, their interactions and communication protocols, and high-level components. Data flow, integration points, scalability, fault tolerance, security aspects, and agent coordination mechanisms will be considered. Specify the technologies, frameworks, and tools to be used for agent development, communication, and deployment. Additionally, include performance optimization strategies and detailed architecture diagrams. To enhance system resilience, I suggest implementing a microservices-based architecture. For this task, please also consider modularizing the design to facilitate future updates and improvements.",
