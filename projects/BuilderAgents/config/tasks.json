Define the high-level components, data flow, and integration points. Consider scalability, fault tolerance, security aspects, and agent coordination mechanisms. Specify the technologies and frameworks to be used for agent development, communication, and deployment. Additionally, include performance optimization strategies and detailed architecture diagrams for better understanding. For this task, I suggest focusing on implementing a microservices-based architecture to allow for independent scaling of each AI agent and improve overall system resilience.",
