#+TITLE: RFC 000: BuilderAgents System Architecture
#+AUTHOR: AI Development Team
#+DATE: 2024-10-25

* Abstract

This RFC proposes the core architecture for the BuilderAgents system, a framework for creating and managing autonomous builder agents that can collaborate on software development tasks.

* Motivation

The need for scalable, autonomous development assistance requires a robust framework that can coordinate multiple AI agents, manage their tasks, and ensure secure and efficient collaboration.

* Design

** Core Components

*** Agent Manager
- Agent lifecycle management
- Capability registration
- Resource allocation
- Health monitoring

*** Task Orchestrator
- Task decomposition
- Priority management
- Dependency resolution
- Progress tracking

*** Knowledge Base
- Shared context storage
- Pattern recognition
- Best practices repository
- Learning outcomes storage

*** Communication Protocol
- Inter-agent messaging
- Event broadcasting
- State synchronization
- Error handling

*** Security Layer
- Access control
- Audit logging
- Sandbox environments
- Credential management

** Implementation Requirements

*** Phase 1: Foundation
- Agent registration system
- Basic task assignment
- Simple knowledge sharing
- Security foundations

*** Phase 2: Enhancement
- Advanced orchestration
- Learning capabilities
- Complex task handling
- Performance optimization

*** Phase 3: Scale
- Multi-project support
- Distributed operations
- Advanced security features
- AI-driven optimization

* Security Considerations

- Sandbox all agent operations
- Implement role-based access control
- Monitor and log all activities
- Regular security audits
