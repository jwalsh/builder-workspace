# BuilderAgents

BuilderAgents is a sophisticated system of multiple specialized AI agents designed to decompose, plan, and implement complex software projects. This innovative approach leverages a team of AI agents with distinct roles to collaboratively break down project requirements, assign tasks, and execute the implementation.

## Project Overview

The BuilderAgents system aims to revolutionize software development by automating and optimizing various stages of the development process. By utilizing AI agents with specialized roles, we can achieve higher efficiency, better resource allocation, and improved overall project quality.

## Key Components

1. Agent Framework: The core infrastructure for creating and managing AI agents.
2. Project Analyzer: Breaks down project requirements into manageable tasks.
3. Task Planner: Generates and optimizes task lists and dependencies.
4. Code Generator: AI-driven system for generating code based on specifications.
5. Testing and Quality Assurance: Automated testing and quality control systems.
6. Agent Collaboration System: Facilitates communication and coordination between agents.
7. Workflow Engine: Manages and executes project workflows.
8. User Interface: Command-line interface for interacting with the BuilderAgents system.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone [repository_url]
   cd BuilderAgents
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment:
   ```
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install dependencies (once requirements.txt is created):
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. [Additional setup steps will be added as the project develops]

## Development Workflow

1. Choose a task from the project board.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix.
3. Develop and test your changes locally.
4. Submit a pull request for review.
5. After approval, merge your changes into the main branch.
