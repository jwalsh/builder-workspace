    "description": "Develop a comprehensive list of project requirements, detailing the range of supported pet species (initially focusing on Dogs and Cats), the diverse vocalizations and behaviors to be interpreted for each species, the desired user-friendly mobile app interface with offline capabilities, and the integration with additional features such as pet health monitoring (including heart rate, activity level, and sleep patterns), community sharing, and emergency response system. Additionally, establish performance benchmarks, privacy policies, and security measures that adhere to industry standards. Suggest a modular design for easy future expansion to other pet species.",
