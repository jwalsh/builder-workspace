    "description": "This RFC proposes a high-level system architecture design for 'AnalisisInmobiliarioIa'. The focus is on a modular and scalable solution that addresses key aspects such as data ingestion, storage (SQL/NoSQL), processing (batch/stream), machine learning model training and deployment, serving predictions, fault tolerance, monitoring, security, and edge cases. This document outlines the following areas for specific attention: data sources, data pipelines, real-time data streaming mechanisms, machine learning model selection and training strategies, API design for prediction serving, deployment infrastructure, CI/CD pipeline setup, database schema design, security measures, incident response plans, system documentation. It also emphasizes on error handling, performance optimizations, and maintainability best practices. The RFC will be refined based on input from 'database-specialist', 'devops-engineer', 'security-specialist'. Subtasks will be created for each specialist to ensure collaboration. Once all collaborators have provided their input, the 'task-decomposer' will integrate their suggestions and update the overall system design. This updated RFC is now ready for the 'task-decomposer' to proceed with task decomposition. The 'project-manager' and 'code-architect' are encouraged to review this document to ensure alignment with project goals and technical feasibility. To improve readability, consider breaking down sections into smaller paragraphs.",
