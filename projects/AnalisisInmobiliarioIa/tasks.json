Key aspects to consider include: data ingestion, storage (SQL/NoSQL), processing (batch/stream), machine learning model training and deployment, serving predictions, fault tolerance, monitoring, security, and edge cases. Ensure consideration of error handling, performance optimizations, and adherence to best practices for maintainability. The following are specific areas to address: data sources, data pipelines, real-time data streaming mechanisms, machine learning model selection and training strategies, API design for prediction serving, deployment infrastructure, CI/CD pipeline setup, database schema design, security measures, and incident response plans.",
