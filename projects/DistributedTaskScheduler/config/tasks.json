    "description": "Gather and document the functional and non-functional requirements for the distributed task scheduler, including scalability, fault tolerance, performance, security considerations, integration with existing systems or third-party services, and clarify any ambiguities or potential edge cases. Address how the system will handle large-scale data processing, real-time job execution, and failure scenarios. Include specific requirements for handling jobs of varying sizes and priorities, job queues, job scheduling algorithms, and monitoring and reporting mechanisms. Also, provide guidelines for configuring the system based on different cluster sizes and workload types.",
