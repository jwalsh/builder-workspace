This includes data models, APIs, integration points, and infrastructure considerations, adhering to best practices for scalability, security, and maintainability. Performance optimization strategies will utilize modern technologies like D3.js or React for interactive and responsive graphics. Emphasis on data privacy using encryption at rest and in transit, anonymization techniques, and compliance with GDPR and other relevant regulations. User experience considerations include intuitive navigation, clear visualizations, and mobile-responsive design. The system will be designed with monitoring and logging capabilities for troubleshooting and performance optimization. Documentation on technical decisions and reasoning will be updated in a readable format for team members. Agile methodologies will be used to enable rapid iteration and feedback during development. Upon review and approval, tasks related to implementation can commence.",
