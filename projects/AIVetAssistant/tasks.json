    "description": "Comprehensively document the requirements for the AIVetAssistant system. This includes: defining a comprehensive list of common pet ailments to be covered, setting achievable but high diagnostic accuracy goals, designing an intuitive user interface that caters to veterinarians' needs (including usability testing with potential users), addressing data privacy and security concerns (including HIPAA compliance if applicable, and GDPR for international users), outlining integration strategies with current veterinary software systems, specifying scalability requirements for future growth, considering edge cases, error handling scenarios, and performance optimizations. Additionally, detail the approach to maintaining data quality, ensuring data is regularly updated and verified. The requirements document should be well-structured, easily accessible, and regularly reviewed. Lastly, ensure the documentation of performance metrics and benchmarks for evaluating system effectiveness, including specific Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Furthermore, consider the need for offline functionality for areas with limited internet connectivity. A section on future research directions to expand the system's capabilities should be included. The RFC is ready for 'IN_PROGRESS'. Please assign this task to the appropriate team member or team members (task-decomposer and project-manager) for further progress.",
