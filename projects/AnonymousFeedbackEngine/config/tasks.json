    "description": "Design the overall system architecture, including components, data flow, security considerations, scalability, and performance optimizations. Ensure proper separation of concerns, modular design, and adherence to best practices. Incorporate microservices architecture for better scalability and maintainability. Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms, ensuring two-factor authentication where possible. Ensure data anonymization and encryption at rest and in transit using industry standard algorithms (e.g., AES-256 for encryption and HMAC-SHA256 for message authentication). Design for high availability and fault tolerance with load balancing and automatic failover mechanisms. Incorporate monitoring, logging, and auditing for better observability, troubleshooting, and regulatory compliance. Consider integrating with existing enterprise systems or third-party services for enhanced functionality or data enrichment, while ensuring proper API security. Upon completion of the design, provide detailed documentation for developers to follow during implementation. Include clear descriptions of each microservice's responsibilities, as well as guidelines for communication between them. Additionally, outline strategies for managing and scaling the databases used in this system. Consider the long-term maintenance and scalability of the architecture, and factor in future improvements or expansions. Upon review, update the rfc_state field to 'NEEDS_MORE_INFO' if additional information is required. Specifically, please provide more details about the specific microservices you plan to use, their roles, and interactions. Also, specify the encryption algorithms to be used for data at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.2). Include a description of how authentication and authorization will be handled (JWT with refresh tokens), and suggest a database management solution (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or DynamoDB) based on the nature of data and expected workload.",

    "description": "Design the database schema and data models for storing feedback data, user information, and related entities. Ensure data privacy, security, scalability requirements are met by implementing necessary encryptions (column-level encryption recommended), anonymization techniques, and data masking strategies. Collaborate with Security Specialist to ensure data protection standards are met. This task involves considering the implications of feedback analysis algorithms on the overall system design. For the database design, focus on normalizing the data for efficient querying, consider using a combination of relational (e.g., PostgreSQL) and NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB or Cassandra) to optimize performance, and ensure that the design allows for future growth and scalability. Implement data versioning and auditing mechanisms to track changes in feedback data over time, using techniques like change data capture (CDC) for efficient audit logging. Suggest exploring the use of column-level encryption for further data protection. Also, research and consider implementing a sharding/partitioning strategy to optimize read and write performance based on access patterns. Update the rfc_state field to 'REVIEW_IN_PROGRESS' as this RFC is ready for review by Database Specialist. Lastly, suggest including a discussion on potential challenges and solutions in the chosen partitioning strategy.",
