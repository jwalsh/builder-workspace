    "description": "Design the overall system architecture, including components, data flow, security considerations, scalability, and performance optimizations. Ensure proper separation of concerns, modular design, and adherence to best practices. Consider incorporating microservices architecture for better scalability and maintainability. Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms, ensuring two-factor authentication where possible. Ensure data anonymization and encryption at rest and in transit using industry standard algorithms. Design for high availability and fault tolerance with load balancing and automatic failover mechanisms. Incorporate monitoring, logging, and auditing for better observability, troubleshooting, and regulatory compliance. Consider integrating with existing enterprise systems or third-party services for enhanced functionality or data enrichment, while ensuring proper API security. Upon completion of the design, provide detailed documentation for developers to follow during implementation. Include clear descriptions of each microservice's responsibilities, as well as guidelines for communication between them. Additionally, outline strategies for managing and scaling the databases used in this system. Consider the long-term maintenance and scalability of the architecture, and factor in future improvements or expansions. Upon review, update the rfc_state field to 'REVIEWED' if ready for further discussion or 'NEEDS_MORE_INFO' if additional information is required.",
