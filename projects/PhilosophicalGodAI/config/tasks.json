    "description": "This RFC aims to clearly define the scope, objectives, and requirements for the PhilosophicalGodAI project. The focus is on establishing a comprehensive list of philosophical questions (e.g., meaning of life, consciousness, free will), targeting Artificial General Intelligence level, detailing the required capabilities (natural language processing, machine learning, knowledge representation), addressing ethical considerations (potential misuse, transparency, accountability), assessing societal impact (short-term and long-term), planning for potential risks or concerns, emphasizing continuous monitoring and evaluation for alignment with societal values and safety guidelines, and refining the project timeline and resource allocation. The task also includes updating and expanding on previous definitions of project scope and requirements.",

The design should also address the scalability and performance requirements of the system, considering potential future expansion. Additionally, propose methods to monitor and update the AI's knowledge base regularly, with a focus on continuous learning and self-improvement mechanisms. Address potential biases in the AI's responses and ensure the AI is designed to learn from its mistakes. The design should also incorporate feedback mechanisms for users to provide input on the AI's responses. The RFC will be reviewed by experts in AI, ethics, and philosophy. Upon approval, begin implementation following the established ethical guidelines and project requirements.",
