This includes edge cases, error handling, performance optimization considerations, and other applicable constraints. Ensure the requirements align with the goals of a reactive UI framework built on functional programming principles, emphasizing declarative UI descriptions and unidirectional data flow. To facilitate collaboration, break down requirements into smaller, manageable tasks as needed. Involve the code-architect for technical decisions and the project-manager to ensure alignment with project goals.",

Utilize industry-standard testing libraries such as Jest or Mocha to ensure maintainability, scalability, and efficiency. Collaborate with developers to develop a test suite that covers all aspects of the framework, including unidirectional data flow, declarative UI descriptions, and functional programming principles. Adopt Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology for increased code quality and maintainability. To enhance clarity, I suggest adding examples or pseudocode snippets in the task description where necessary. Update the tests regularly to ensure compatibility with any future updates or additions to the framework. Upon completion, provide a detailed report summarizing the results of all test cases.",
