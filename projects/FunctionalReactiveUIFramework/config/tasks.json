This includes edge cases, error handling, performance optimization considerations, and other applicable constraints. Ensure the requirements align with the goals of a reactive UI framework built on functional programming principles, emphasizing declarative UI descriptions and unidirectional data flow. To facilitate collaboration, break down requirements into smaller, manageable tasks as needed. Involve the code-architect for technical decisions and the project-manager to ensure alignment with project goals.",
