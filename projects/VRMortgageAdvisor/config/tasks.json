    "description": "Create a comprehensive design for the VR environment including user interface, navigation, interactive elements, data flow, and integration with mortgage calculation and recommendation engines. Focus on immersive 3D graphics, spatial audio, hand/gesture tracking, voice commands, and ensure accessibility and responsiveness to various devices. Consider incorporating visual feedback mechanisms, intuitive UI/UX designs, and optimizing performance for a seamless user experience. Also, integrate virtual learning modules and interactive tools for financial education. In addition, prioritize mobile-first approach while designing, ensure that the design complies with VR accessibility guidelines, integrate analytics to track user behavior and improve the platform based on insights, collaborate closely with other teams such as UX/UI, frontend, backend, and devops during the design process, conduct usability testing regularly to refine and iterate the design. Update the following points: \n1. Prioritize mobile-first approach while designing (add explicit mention of VR-specific considerations)\n2. Ensure that the design complies with VR accessibility guidelines (provide specific guidelines or references)\n3. Integrate analytics to track user behavior and improve the platform based on insights (specify the type of analytics to be used, for example Google Analytics or Mixpanel)\n4. Collaborate closely with other teams such as UX/UI, frontend, backend, and devops during the design process (add QA-tester and Security-Specialist to the list of teams)\n5. Conduct usability testing regularly to refine and iterate the design (provide specific details about the usability testing, for example number of tests per week or monthly frequency)",

    "description": "Implement robust security and privacy measures to safeguard user data. This includes encryption (AES-256 for data at rest and TLS 1.2+ for data in transit), access controls (Role Based Access Control, Least Privilege Principle, implementing OAuth/OIDC for authentication), anonymization techniques (e.g., pseudonymization, hashing, and consideration of differential privacy where applicable), compliance with GDPR, CCPA, PCI-DSS, and other relevant regulations. Create policies for data handling, incident response, and regular security audits (including penetration testing). Ensure these measures are implemented throughout the entire system, not just at specific touchpoints (e.g., frontend, backend, database). Collaborate closely with all team members to ensure integration of these measures from project planning through to deployment. Additionally, incorporate principles such as Privacy by Design and Data Protection by Default. Incorporate security features in the software development life cycle (SDLC), including secure coding practices, code reviews, and automated vulnerability scanning tools. Suggest adding multi-factor authentication for enhanced user security. Also, consider using a reputable third-party service for data storage and management to further bolster security. If possible, implement end-to-end encryption for increased data protection. Finally, document the implemented security measures clearly in the project's technical documentation.",
