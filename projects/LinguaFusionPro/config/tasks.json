Address potential challenges in implementing the strategy, such as data privacy concerns, language-specific complexities, and methods for integrating new languages into the system. Consider the impact of GDPR and other regional data protection regulations on the design. Also, suggest methods for improving the efficiency and accuracy of machine learning models in handling multiple languages.",
