    "description": "Gather and document the requirements for the BioInformaticsPipeline project, including input data formats (FASTA, VCF, BAM), analysis techniques (variant calling, gene expression analysis, mutation annotation, and visualization tools), output formats (VCF, TSV), performance requirements (24-hour processing for a human genome with the ability to scale for larger datasets), security considerations (HIPAA compliance, encryption at rest and in transit, access controls, and auditing logs), integration with existing systems (GenomeAnalysisToolkit, Cromwell, and any other relevant tools), and detailed documentation of these requirements. Update the project repository with this document. Suggested improvements: Clarify the expected level of detail for each requirement, define a process for handling updates to these requirements, and ensure that the requirements are flexible enough to accommodate future advancements in genomic data analysis. Update the project repository with this revised document. Assign the task to the code-architect or project-manager for further development.",
