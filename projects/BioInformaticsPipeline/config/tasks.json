    "description": "Gather and document the requirements for the BioInformaticsPipeline project, including input data formats (FASTA, VCF, BAM), analysis techniques (variant calling, gene expression analysis, mutation annotation, visualization tools, and statistical methods), output formats (VCF, TSV), performance requirements (24-hour processing for a human genome with the ability to scale for larger datasets), security considerations (HIPAA compliance, encryption at rest and in transit, access controls, auditing logs, data de-identification, and incident response plan), integration with existing systems (GenomeAnalysisToolkit, Cromwell, and any other relevant tools), and detailed documentation of these requirements. The expected level of detail for each requirement is specific enough for developers to understand how to implement the feature, while allowing flexibility for future advancements in genomic data analysis. Define a clear process for handling updates to these requirements, ensuring that the document remains up-to-date. Provide a change log to track updates and their impacts on the system. Update the project repository with this revised document and assign it to the task-decomposer or project-manager for further decomposition and development. Suggested improvements: Clarify the expected level of detail for each requirement, define a process for handling updates to these requirements, ensure that the requirements are flexible enough to accommodate future advancements in genomic data analysis, provide a clear process for handling changes and updates, include a change log for tracking updates and their impacts on the system, and consider incorporating AI/ML techniques for automation and improved analysis. Update the 'assigned_to' field to 'code-architect'.",
