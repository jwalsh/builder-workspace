    "title": "Architecture and Design",
    "description": "Design the overall system architecture, including the front-end and back-end components, data models, and communication protocols. Consider the following aspects:\n\n1. Front-end: Develop a user-friendly interface for visualizing algorithms and data structures. Investigate open-source libraries or frameworks that can facilitate interactive visualizations while considering accessibility, responsive design, performance optimization, and maintaining compatibility with modern browsers.\n   - Suggestion: Use React + D3.js/Vega-Lite for the frontend as they are popular choices for data visualization and offer good community support, flexibility, and performance.\n\n2. Back-end: Implement the logic for various algorithms and data structures. Ensure modularity, extensibility, and testability to support future additions and updates. Consider microservices architecture for better scalability and service isolation. Use a programming language that is efficient and popular among developers (e.g., Python, Java, or Node.js).\n   - Suggestion: Implement the backend using a combination of Python (for its simplicity, readability, and strong data analysis libraries) and Node.js (for real-time capabilities and event-driven architectures).\n\n3. Data Models: Define data models for storing algorithm and data structure information, user preferences, and any other necessary data. Normalization is crucial, but keep in mind the trade-off between normalization and query performance for complex queries.\n   - Suggestion: Use ORM tools like SQLAlchemy or Django ORM to simplify database interactions.\n\n4. Communication Protocols: Establish communication protocols between the front-end and back-end components, ensuring efficient data transfer and real-time updates while considering security, performance optimizations, and event-driven architectures. Use REST or GraphQL APIs for easy integration with third-party tools.\n   - Suggestion: Implement GraphQL APIs for better flexibility in handling complex queries and mutations.\n\n5. Scalability: Ensure the architecture can handle an increasing number of users and algorithms without compromising performance. Consider caching mechanisms, load balancing, and horizontal scalability in the design phase. Use a cloud service like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure to facilitate scaling.\n   - Suggestion: Implement serverless functions using AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions for better cost efficiency and scalability.\n\n6. Security: Implement appropriate security measures to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access or misuse of the platform while adhering to industry best practices for secure coding and OWASP guidelines.\n   - Suggestion: Use JWT for authentication and authorization, along with HTTPS.\n\n7. Extensibility: Design the architecture to be extensible, allowing for easy integration of new algorithms, data structures, and features in the future. Ensure that the system can grow organically without compromising maintainability.\n   - Suggestion: Use Containerization (Docker) and Orchestration (Kubernetes) for easier deployment, scaling, and management.\n\n8. Performance Optimizations: Consider performance bottlenecks during design and implementation phases, ensuring the platform delivers fast responses and smooth user experiences. Use profiling tools to identify and optimize slow functions or queries.\n   - Suggestion: Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data, as well as optimization techniques like query optimization and database indexing.\n\n9. Error Handling: Implement robust error handling mechanisms to minimize the impact of failures on users while providing valuable insights for debugging and improving the system.\n   - Suggestion: Use structured exception handling (SEH) and proper logging.\n\n10. Documentation: Create clear and concise documentation for each component, helping developers understand how to use, test, maintain, and extend the platform. Include API documentation for easy integration with third-party tools. Use Doxygen or Javadoc for code documentation.\n   - Suggestion: Write comprehensive documentation using Markdown and host it on a platform like GitBook or ReadTheDocs.",
