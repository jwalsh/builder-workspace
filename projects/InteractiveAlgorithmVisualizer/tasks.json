    "description": "Design the overall system architecture, including the front-end and back-end components, data models, and communication protocols. Consider the following aspects:\n\n1. Front-end: Develop a user-friendly interface for visualizing algorithms and data structures. Investigate open-source libraries or frameworks that can facilitate interactive visualizations while considering accessibility and responsive design.\n\n2. Back-end: Implement the logic for various algorithms and data structures. Ensure modularity, extensibility, and testability to support future additions and updates.\n\n3. Data Models: Define data models for storing algorithm and data structure information, user preferences, and any other necessary data. Consider normalization, consistency, and efficient querying.\n\n4. Communication Protocols: Establish communication protocols between the front-end and back-end components, ensuring efficient data transfer and real-time updates while considering security and performance optimizations.\n\n5. Scalability: Ensure the architecture can handle an increasing number of users and algorithms without compromising performance, considering caching mechanisms, load balancing, and horizontal scalability.\n\n6. Security: Implement appropriate security measures to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access or misuse of the platform while adhering to industry best practices for secure coding.\n\n7. Extensibility: Design the architecture to be extensible, allowing for easy integration of new algorithms, data structures, and features in the future. Ensure that the system can grow organically without compromising maintainability.\n\n8. Performance Optimizations: Consider performance bottlenecks during design and implementation phases, ensuring the platform delivers fast responses and smooth user experiences.\n\n9. Error Handling: Implement robust error handling mechanisms to minimize the impact of failures on users while providing valuable insights for debugging and improving the system.\n\n10. Documentation: Create clear and concise documentation for each component, helping developers understand how to use, test, maintain, and extend the platform.",
