    "description": "Collect and document detailed requirements for the automated financial audit system. The documentation should cover input data formats (including any specific validation rules), desired outputs, security and compliance needs (including relevant regulations and standards such as GDPR, PCI-DSS, SOC 2, etc.), performance expectations, integration points with existing systems or third-party services, potential edge cases, usability aspects of the system, and accessibility considerations. The documentation should also address non-functional requirements like scalability, reliability, and maintainability. It is crucial to involve stakeholders from various departments (e.g., finance, IT, compliance) during this phase to ensure all necessary requirements are captured. This documentation will serve as a foundation for the development phase.",
