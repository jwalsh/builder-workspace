    "description": "Collect and document detailed requirements for the automated financial audit system. The documentation should cover input data formats (including any specific validation rules), desired outputs, security and compliance needs (including relevant regulations and standards such as GDPR, PCI-DSS, SOC 2, etc.), performance expectations, integration points with existing systems or third-party services, potential edge cases, usability aspects of the system, and accessibility considerations. The documentation should also address non-functional requirements like scalability, reliability, maintainability, and security (considering OWASP Top Ten Risks as a starting point). It is crucial to involve stakeholders from various departments (e.g., finance, IT, compliance) during this phase to ensure all necessary requirements are captured. This documentation will serve as a foundation for the development phase. To enhance clarity and completeness, consider breaking down the requirements into smaller, manageable pieces. Additionally, it would be beneficial to identify any specific tools or technologies that may be relevant for the system's design and implementation, including open-source libraries or frameworks. Lastly, document any assumptions made during this process for transparency and potential future reference. This updated documentation will be reviewed by the code-architect before moving forward. After review, the task will be reassigned to the task-decomposer for further breakdown.",
