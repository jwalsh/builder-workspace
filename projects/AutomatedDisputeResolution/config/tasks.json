    "description": "1. Gather and document the project requirements, including the types of legal disputes to be handled (e.g., contract disputes, property disputes, consumer disputes).\n2. Identify desired features such as AI-powered negotiation and mediation, dispute tracking, evidence management, communication channels.\n3a. Define user roles (lawyer, client, arbitrator) with clear responsibilities and access levels.\n3b. Consider the potential need for additional roles such as legal assistant or court representative.\n4. Detail integration requirements with existing legal systems and databases (e.g., court records, government databases, case law databases), including APIs and data standards.\n5. Ensure compliance with relevant laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions by consulting with local legal experts.\n6. Address data privacy and security concerns, including GDPR, HIPAA, and other applicable privacy frameworks, while also considering regional variations and best practices.\n7. Specify scalability and performance requirements for handling large volumes of disputes, taking into account potential future growth.\n8. Identify potential risks and constraints, such as liability exposure, ethical considerations, the impact on employment, and the need for regular compliance audits.\n9. Prepare a high-level architecture design, including system components, data flow diagrams, and proposed technology stack to serve as a basis for the development process.\n10. Update the project roadmap to reflect the completion of this task and any subsequent tasks required.\n11. Assign subsequent tasks to appropriate team members based on their skills and expertise.\n12. Review and update this RFC based on feedback from relevant stakeholders, especially legal experts.\n13. Once updated, assign back to the project manager for review and approval.\n14. Update the rfc_state field to 'IN_PROGRESS' as I am in the process of refining some details.",
