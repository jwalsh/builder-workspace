Consider factors such as scalability, performance, ease of querying, and data integrity constraints. This model should be designed with future expansions in mind, ensuring flexibility and adaptability. The model should include a comprehensive documentation detailing each entity, relationship, and any necessary constraints. The documentation should be written in a way that is easily understandable by both technical and non-technical stakeholders. In addition, consider using industry best practices for data modeling, such as ER modeling or OO modeling, to ensure consistency and ease of maintenance. Furthermore, suggest potential use cases and edge cases to cover during the model's implementation.",

    "description": "Ensure data privacy and access control for sensitive career path information. This includes implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms using industry-standard protocols like OAuth 2.0 and JSON Web Tokens (JWT), data encryption at rest and in transit using strong ciphers like AES-256, secure communication protocols like HTTPS with up-to-date TLS versions, regular security audits and vulnerability assessments using automated tools and manual penetration testing. To further enhance data privacy, consider implementing role-based access control (RBAC), IP address restriction for login attempts, user session management for idle logouts or timeouts, and a mechanism to notify users about suspicious login activities. Additionally, implement features such as secure coding practices like input validation, output encoding, protection against common web vulnerabilities like XSS, CSRF, and SQL injection. Lastly, update the project documentation to clearly outline the implemented security measures and provide guidelines for secure coding practices. Upon completion of these tasks, conduct a review for potential improvements or adjustments.",
