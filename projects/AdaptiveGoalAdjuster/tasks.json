    "description": "This RFC proposes the gathering and documentation of comprehensive requirements for the AdaptiveGoalAdjuster system. The following areas are to be addressed: 1) Desired features and functionality, detailing both user-facing aspects and backend processes, including specific use cases, 2) Integration with existing systems (e.g., HR systems, performance management tools, goal tracking tools), providing specific APIs or interfaces required and identifying any potential challenges or limitations, 3) User roles and permissions, outlining role hierarchies, permission levels, and access controls, with an emphasis on securing sensitive data and ensuring user privacy, 4) Data privacy and security considerations (e.g., GDPR compliance), including data storage, transmission, and deletion policies, as well as incident response plans and disaster recovery strategies, 5) Scalability and performance requirements, with benchmarks for expected user load and system responsiveness, considering edge cases and potential bottlenecks, 6) Any specific constraints or assumptions, such as hardware or software limitations, technology trends, and best practices, 7) A high-level architectural design, including the proposed tech stack, database schema, and API structure, with an emphasis on microservices, containerization, and cloud deployment for scalability and flexibility, 8) Non-functional requirements like usability, accessibility, maintainability, testability, and localization considerations, 9) Success criteria and key performance indicators (KPIs), to measure the effectiveness of the system and its impact on employee productivity and satisfaction. Upon completion of this task, a clear understanding of the project scope will be established, facilitating efficient planning and execution. Note: This RFC may require input from multiple team members, so collaboration is key. Assign to: project-manager for further decomposition into tasks.",
