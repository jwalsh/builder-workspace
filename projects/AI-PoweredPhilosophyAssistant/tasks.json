Consider scalability, performance, maintainability, modularity, security aspects, edge cases, error handling, and performance optimizations. Incorporate guidelines for testing, documentation, and version control, including unit tests, integration tests, code comments, and clear documentation of each component and their interactions. Propose a strategy for continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) to ensure efficient software development, delivery, and maintenance.
