    "description": "Design the overall system architecture, including the brain-computer interface (BCI), dream analysis algorithms, travel recommendation engine, data storage, and security considerations. The design should be scalable, secure, and efficient in handling large amounts of dream data, focusing on real-time processing capabilities for the BCI and seamless integration with the rest of the system components. This architecture should also comply with ethical and legal guidelines, taking into account privacy concerns related to user data. Incorporate machine learning techniques for dream analysis and recommendation algorithms. Specify interfaces for user interaction and feedback mechanisms. The design should be modular and flexible enough to accommodate future improvements or changes in technology. Consider using containerization technologies like Docker for scalability and portability, and Kubernetes for deployment management. To ensure the system's efficiency, implement caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data. For real-time data processing, consider utilizing stream processing technologies such as Apache Flink or Apache Storm. Incorporate monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana for performance monitoring. This RFC is ready for the next state, awaiting input from task-decomposer for breaking down the tasks into smaller, manageable units.",
