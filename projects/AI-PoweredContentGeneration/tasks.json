    "description": "This RFC aims to gather and document the comprehensive project requirements for AI-PoweredContentGeneration. The scope encompasses defining the types of content (articles, videos, social media posts), target audiences, personalization criteria (demographics, interests, behavior, psychographics), desired output formats (text, images, audio), content tone, style, and quality standards. Furthermore, considerations should be made for potential scalability requirements, error handling mechanisms, data privacy concerns, content templates, integrations, API usage, and any additional specifications. The AI system's functionality should also account for content generation based on real-time events, sentiment analysis, and dynamic personalization. Upon completion, the gathered requirements will be documented in a clear and concise manner to facilitate efficient project execution.",
