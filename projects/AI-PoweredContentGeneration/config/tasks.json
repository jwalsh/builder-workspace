    "description": "This RFC aims to gather and document the comprehensive project requirements for AI-PoweredContentGeneration. The scope encompasses defining the types of content (articles, videos, social media posts), target audiences, personalization criteria (demographics, interests, behavior, psychographics), desired output formats (text, images, audio), content tone and style, quality standards, real-time event responsiveness, scalability, error handling mechanisms, data privacy concerns, content templates, integrations, API usage, sentiment analysis, dynamic personalization, and potential future enhancements. The project requirements will also consider aspects such as sentiment analysis, dynamic personalization, and potential future enhancements. The AI system's functionality should account for these aspects upon completion.\n\nTo clarify, the system should be capable of generating personalized content based on user demographics, interests, behavior, and psychographics. The generated content can include articles, videos, social media posts, etc., in various formats such as text, images, or audio, with a specific tone and style. Additionally, the AI should respond to real-time events and be scalable for handling large volumes of data.\n\nFor data privacy concerns, it is important that user information is protected and used only for content personalization purposes. The system should also have error handling mechanisms in place to ensure reliable operation. For the purpose of this RFC, we will focus on defining the specific requirements for sentiment analysis, dynamic personalization, and potential future enhancements.\n\nUpon review, the document should be updated with clear, concise, and unambiguous requirements that can facilitate efficient project execution.",
