    "description": "Define the project scope, objectives, and requirements for the AIStructuralAnalyzer tool. This includes gathering input from stakeholders (architects, engineers, building inspectors, construction companies, etc.) to understand their needs, pain points, and existing workflows. Research existing solutions, industry standards/regulations (e.g., building codes, safety guidelines), and relevant AI/ML techniques for structural analysis. Identify key features, functionalities, and performance requirements (e.g., accuracy, speed, scalability). Outline the overall system architecture, including the AI/ML components (e.g., computer vision, structural analysis models), user interface (e.g., CAD integration, reporting), data storage (e.g., building designs, analysis results), and integration with external systems (e.g., CAD software, building codes databases, construction management tools). Develop a project plan with milestones, timelines, resource estimates, and risk management strategies.",
