# RFC 518: System Architecture Design

**Project:** AdFlow
**Status:** TODO
**Assigned to:** code-architect
**Priority:** 1
**Dependencies:** Project Planning and Requirements Gathering
**Task Type:** RFC
**RFC State:** REVIEW

## Description:

This RFC aims to design the comprehensive system architecture for the AdFlow platform. It will encompass the definition of components, data flow, integration points, and key considerations for ensuring scalability, maintainability, and security. The architecture should effectively address the following functional areas:

* Campaign Management
* Content Item Approval
* User Management
* Campaign Auditing

## Key Considerations:

* **Scalability:** The architecture should be capable of handling increasing loads of data and users without significant performance degradation.
* **Maintainability:** The system should be designed in a modular and well-structured manner, promoting ease of understanding, modification, and troubleshooting.
* **Security:** Robust security measures should be incorporated to safeguard sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access.
* **Integration:** The architecture should facilitate seamless integration with external systems and services as required.
* **Performance:** The design should prioritize optimal performance to ensure a smooth user experience.

## Next Steps:

1. **Gather Requirements:** Collaborate with stakeholders to gather detailed requirements and constraints for the system architecture.
2. **Component Identification:** Identify and define the core components of the AdFlow platform.
3. **Data Flow Design:** Outline the flow of data between different components and systems.
4. **Integration Points:** Specify the integration points with external systems or services.
5. **Scalability and Performance Strategies:** Propose strategies to ensure the architecture can scale horizontally and vertically to accommodate future growth.
6. **Security Measures:** Outline security measures to protect data and prevent unauthorized access.
7. **Documentation:** Create comprehensive documentation of the system architecture.

## Review:

This RFC is currently under review. Please provide feedback and suggestions to improve the proposed architecture.
