# RFC 004: Expanded Deployment Options

## Introduction

This RFC expands on the deployment options for our Project Manager application, considering a wide range of scenarios from local development to cloud-based solutions. The goal is to provide flexibility for different use cases while highlighting the trade-offs in terms of isolation, security, and ease of use.

## Deployment Options

### 1. Run Locally Without Isolation

#### Description
Run the Project Manager directly on the local machine without any isolation or protection mechanisms.

#### Setup
```bash
python3 project_manager.py
```

#### Pros
- Simplest setup
- Direct access to all local resources
- No overhead from virtualization or containerization

#### Cons
- No isolation from the host system
- Potential for LLM-generated input to leak data or damage the host system
- Inconsistent environment across different machines

#### Use Case
Development and testing on a trusted machine where ease of use is prioritized over security.

### 2. Python Virtual Environment

#### Description
Use Python's built-in venv module to create an isolated environment for dependencies.

#### Setup
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python project_manager.py
```

#### Pros
- Isolates Python dependencies
- Easy to set up and use
- Lightweight

#### Cons
- Limited isolation (only for Python packages)
- No system-level isolation

#### Use Case
Local development and testing where dependency isolation is needed.

### 3. Docker Container

#### Description
Run the Project Manager in a Docker container, isolating it from the host system.

#### Setup
```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  project_manager:
    build: .
    volumes:
      - .:/app
```

#### Pros
- Consistent environment across different machines
- Good isolation from the host system
- Easy to deploy and scale

#### Cons
- Requires Docker knowledge
- Slight performance overhead

#### Use Case
Team development, CI/CD pipelines, and light production use.

### 4. VPS with Hosting Provider

#### Description
Deploy the Project Manager on a Virtual Private Server (VPS) from a hosting provider like DigitalOcean, Linode, or Vultr.

#### Setup
1. Provision a VPS
2. SSH into the server
3. Install dependencies and set up the Project Manager

#### Pros
- Full control over the server environment
- Can be cost-effective for small to medium-scale deployments
- Flexibility in choosing the operating system and configuration

#### Cons
- Requires server management skills
- Responsibility for security and updates

#### Use Case
Small to medium-scale production deployments or staging environments.

### 5. Dedicated Hardware

#### Description
Install and run the Project Manager on a dedicated physical machine with no other installations or setups.

#### Setup
1. Set up the bare metal server
2. Install the operating system
3. Install dependencies and set up the Project Manager

#### Pros
- Maximum control over hardware and software
- Potential for high performance
- No resource sharing with other users or systems

#### Cons
- High upfront cost
- Requires physical access for maintenance
- Responsibility for all aspects of server management

#### Use Case
High-performance requirements or situations where complete control over the hardware is necessary.

### 6. Cloud Compute (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure)

#### Description
Deploy the Project Manager on cloud computing platforms using services like AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine, or Azure Virtual Machines.

#### Setup
1. Create a cloud account
2. Provision a virtual machine
3. Deploy the Project Manager using cloud-native tools or scripts

#### Pros
- Scalability and flexibility
- Access to a wide range of cloud services
- Pay-as-you-go pricing model

#### Cons
- Can be complex to set up and manage
- Potential for unexpected costs if not monitored
- Vendor lock-in concerns

#### Use Case
Scalable production deployments, especially when integrating with other cloud services.

### 7. Replit

#### Description
Develop and run the Project Manager directly in Replit's online IDE and hosting environment.

#### Setup
1. Create a Repl for the Project Manager
2. Upload or create the necessary files
3. Use Replit's run button to start the application

#### Pros
- Very easy to set up and share
- Built-in version control and collaboration features
- Free tier available for small projects

#### Cons
- Limited resources on free tier
- Less control over the environment
- Internet connection required for development

#### Use Case
Quick prototyping, educational purposes, or small-scale projects.

### 8. GitHub Codespaces

#### Description
Develop and run the Project Manager in a GitHub Codespace, which provides a complete, configurable dev environment in the cloud.

#### Setup
1. Enable GitHub Codespaces for the repository
2. Create a devcontainer configuration
3. Launch a Codespace and run the Project Manager

#### Pros
- Consistent development environment for all contributors
- Integrates well with GitHub workflows
- Can be customized to match production environments

#### Cons
- Requires GitHub account and may have associated costs
- Internet connection required for development
- Potential for resource limitations

#### Use Case
Team development, open-source projects, or scenarios where a consistent dev environment is crucial.

### 9. Nix Shell

#### Description
Use Nix to create a reproducible development environment for the Project Manager.

#### Setup
```bash
nix-shell --pure shell.nix
python project_manager.py
```

#### Pros
- Highly reproducible environment
- Precise control over dependencies
- Works across different Linux distributions and macOS

#### Cons
- Steep learning curve for Nix
- Can be slow to set up initially
- Limited Windows support

#### Use Case
Development teams prioritizing reproducibility and long-term maintenance.

### 10. Python Virtual Environment with Network Namespaces

#### Description
Use Python virtual environments combined with Linux network namespaces for enhanced isolation.

#### Setup
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
sudo ip netns add project_manager_ns
sudo ip netns exec project_manager_ns python project_manager.py
```

#### Pros
- Combines dependency isolation with network isolation
- More secure than a standard virtual environment
- Lightweight compared to full containerization

#### Cons
- Requires root access
- Linux-specific solution
- More complex setup

#### Use Case
Development or production scenarios requiring network isolation without full containerization.

### 11. Kubernetes Pod

#### Description
Deploy the Project Manager as a pod in a Kubernetes cluster.

#### Setup
1. Create a Dockerfile for the Project Manager
2. Create Kubernetes deployment and service YAML files
3. Deploy to a Kubernetes cluster

#### Pros
- Highly scalable and manageable
- Built-in service discovery and load balancing
- Consistent environment across development and production

#### Cons
- Complex setup and management
- Requires knowledge of Kubernetes
- Potential overkill for small projects

#### Use Case
Large-scale production deployments, microservices architectures, or organizations already using Kubernetes.

## Recommendation

The choice of deployment option depends on the specific needs of the project:

1. For quick development and testing, options 1 (Run Locally) or 2 (Python Virtual Environment) are suitable.
2. For team development and light production use, options 3 (Docker Container) or 8 (GitHub Codespaces) provide a good balance.
3. For scalable production deployments, options 6 (Cloud Compute) or 11 (Kubernetes Pod) offer the most flexibility and power.
4. For maximum control and performance, option 5 (Dedicated Hardware) might be necessary.

It's important to note that option 1 (Run Locally Without Isolation) carries significant risks and should only be used in controlled environments where the potential for data leakage or system damage is acceptable.

## Next Steps

1. Assess the project's current needs and future growth projections.
2. Choose the most appropriate deployment option based on the assessment.
3. Create detailed setup instructions for the chosen option(s).
4. Implement safeguards and monitoring, especially for less isolated options.
5. Develop a migration plan for moving between deployment options as the project evolves.
