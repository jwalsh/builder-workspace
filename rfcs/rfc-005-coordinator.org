#+TITLE: RFC: Secure Environment for Coordinator
#+AUTHOR: AI Assistant
#+DATE: [2024-03-19 Tue]

* Introduction

This RFC proposes options for creating a secure environment for the Coordinator, our AI-powered project management assistant. The goal is to ensure that Coordinator has access to all necessary services while maintaining security and flexibility across different deployment scenarios.

* Current Setup

The Coordinator is part of a project structure that includes:

- PROJECTS.org: Main project definitions file
- README.org: Project documentation
- ai_pro_cat.py: AI-powered project categorization script
- arxiv_cache.json: Cache for arXiv paper information
- categories.csv: List of project categories
- category_projects_for_test_training.csv: Data for training categorization models
- project_similarity_clusters.png: Visualization of project similarities
- pyproject.toml: Python project configuration

* Deployment Options

** Option 1: Local Development Environment

*** Description
Run Coordinator directly on the developer's machine, utilizing existing Ollama installation and local file system.

*** Implementation
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python coordinator.py
#+END_SRC

*** Pros
- Simple setup
- Direct access to local files and Ollama
- Easy debugging

*** Cons
- Less isolated
- Potential conflicts with other Python projects

** Option 2: Docker Container

*** Description
Run Coordinator in a Docker container, with Ollama either in a separate container or accessed from the host.

*** Implementation
#+BEGIN_SRC yaml
version: '3'
services:
  coordinator:
    build: .
    volumes:
      - .:/app
      - ./secrets.json:/app/secrets.json
    environment:
      - OLLAMA_API_BASE_URL=http://host.docker.internal:11434
    extra_hosts:
      - "host.docker.internal:host-gateway"
#+END_SRC

*** Pros
- Isolated environment
- Consistent across different machines
- Easy to deploy

*** Cons
- Requires Docker knowledge
- Potential performance overhead

** Option 3: Cloud Deployment

*** Description
Deploy Coordinator on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Azure) with appropriate security measures.

*** Implementation
- Use cloud-native services for secrets management (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager)
- Set up VPC and security groups
- Use managed Kubernetes for orchestration if needed

*** Pros
- Scalable
- Managed services for security and monitoring
- Suitable for production use

*** Cons
- More complex setup
- Potential cost implications

* Security Considerations

** Secrets Management
- Use environment variables or a secrets management service
- Never commit secrets to version control

** Access Control
- Implement strong authentication for Coordinator API
- Use principle of least privilege for all components

** Data Protection
- Encrypt data at rest and in transit
- Regularly backup project data

** Monitoring and Logging
- Implement comprehensive logging
- Set up alerts for unusual activity

* Recommendations

1. For development: Use Option 1 (Local Development Environment) for simplicity and ease of debugging.
2. For testing and staging: Use Option 2 (Docker Container) to ensure consistency across environments.
3. For production: Use Option 3 (Cloud Deployment) for scalability and managed security features.

* Next Steps

1. Choose the appropriate deployment option based on the current project phase.
2. Implement the chosen option, ensuring Coordinator has access to all required services (Ollama, file system, etc.).
3. Set up monitoring and logging for the chosen environment.
4. Create a contrib guide for developers, explaining how to set up and use the Coordinator in different environments.
5. Regularly review and update the security measures as the project evolves.

* Conclusion

By implementing a secure environment for Coordinator, we can ensure that our AI-powered project management assistant can function effectively while maintaining the security and integrity of our project data. The proposed options provide flexibility for different stages of development and deployment.
