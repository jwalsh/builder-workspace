# RFC 010: Agent-Driven Development Framework

## Background

Our project has successfully integrated multiple language model providers and implemented a flexible system for AI-assisted tasks. To further enhance our capabilities and streamline our development process, we propose implementing an agent-driven development framework. This framework will allow for more autonomous and specialized AI agents to handle various aspects of our software development lifecycle.

## Motivation

1. Increase automation in our development process
2. Leverage specialized AI agents for specific tasks
3. Improve code quality and consistency
4. Reduce human intervention in routine tasks
5. Create a more scalable and flexible development pipeline

## Proposal

We propose to build an Agent-Driven Development Framework that extends our current provider/model infrastructure. This framework will consist of the following components:

1. Agent Registry
2. Task Dispatcher
3. Agent Communication Protocol
4. Result Aggregator
5. Human-in-the-Loop Interface

### 1. Agent Registry

Create a centralized registry for all available agents. Each agent will have:

- A unique identifier
- Specific capabilities and areas of expertise
- Required input format
- Expected output format

```python
class Agent:
    def __init__(self, id: str, capabilities: List[str], provider: LLMProvider):
        self.id = id
        self.capabilities = capabilities
        self.provider = provider

    async def execute(self, task: Dict) -> Dict:
        # Implementation of agent-specific logic
        pass

class AgentRegistry:
    def __init__(self):
        self.agents = {}

    def register_agent(self, agent: Agent):
        self.agents[agent.id] = agent

    def get_agent(self, agent_id: str) -> Agent:
        return self.agents.get(agent_id)

    def find_agents_by_capability(self, capability: str) -> List[Agent]:
        return [agent for agent in self.agents.values() if capability in agent.capabilities]
```

### 2. Task Dispatcher

Implement a task dispatcher that can:

- Break down complex tasks into subtasks
- Assign subtasks to appropriate agents based on their capabilities
- Manage task dependencies and execution order

```python
class TaskDispatcher:
    def __init__(self, agent_registry: AgentRegistry):
        self.agent_registry = agent_registry

    async def dispatch_task(self, task: Dict) -> List[Dict]:
        subtasks = self.break_down_task(task)
        results = []
        for subtask in subtasks:
            agent = self.find_suitable_agent(subtask)
            result = await agent.execute(subtask)
            results.append(result)
        return results

    def break_down_task(self, task: Dict) -> List[Dict]:
        # Logic to break down complex tasks
        pass

    def find_suitable_agent(self, task: Dict) -> Agent:
        required_capability = task['required_capability']
        agents = self.agent_registry.find_agents_by_capability(required_capability)
        return agents[0] if agents else None
```

### 3. Agent Communication Protocol

Define a standardized protocol for agents to communicate with each other and the main system:

```python
class AgentMessage:
    def __init__(self, sender: str, receiver: str, content: Dict):
        self.sender = sender
        self.receiver = receiver
        self.content = content

class AgentCommunicator:
    async def send_message(self, message: AgentMessage):
        # Logic to send messages between agents
        pass

    async def receive_message(self, agent_id: str) -> AgentMessage:
        # Logic to receive messages for a specific agent
        pass
```

### 4. Result Aggregator

Implement a system to collect and combine results from multiple agents:

```python
class ResultAggregator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.results = {}

    def add_result(self, task_id: str, agent_id: str, result: Dict):
        if task_id not in self.results:
            self.results[task_id] = {}
        self.results[task_id][agent_id] = result

    def get_aggregated_result(self, task_id: str) -> Dict:
        # Logic to combine results from multiple agents
        pass
```

### 5. Human-in-the-Loop Interface

Create an interface for human developers to intervene, provide feedback, or make decisions when necessary:

```python
class HumanInterface:
    async def request_human_input(self, prompt: str) -> str:
        # Implementation to get input from a human developer
        pass

    async def display_results(self, results: Dict):
        # Implementation to show results to a human developer
        pass

    async def get_approval(self, proposal: Dict) -> bool:
        # Implementation to get approval from a human developer
        pass
```

## Implementation Plan

1. Develop the Agent Registry system
2. Implement the Task Dispatcher
3. Create the Agent Communication Protocol
4. Build the Result Aggregator
5. Develop the Human-in-the-Loop Interface
6. Integrate the new components with our existing LLM provider framework
7. Create specialized agents for common development tasks (e.g., code review, testing, documentation)
8. Implement a plugin system for easy addition of new agents
9. Develop a configuration system for customizing the agent-driven workflow
10. Create comprehensive documentation and examples

## Security Considerations

- Implement proper authentication and authorization for agent communications
- Ensure that sensitive information is not shared unnecessarily between agents
- Regularly audit agent actions and results for potential security issues
- Implement rate limiting and resource allocation to prevent abuse

## Alternatives Considered

- Using a third-party agent framework instead of building our own
- Implementing a fully autonomous system without human intervention
- Focusing on improving individual LLM providers instead of creating an agent system

## Open Questions

- How do we handle conflicts or inconsistencies between agent results?
- What metrics should we use to evaluate the effectiveness of the agent-driven development process?
- How do we ensure that the system remains flexible enough to accommodate future AI advancements?

## Future Work

- Implement learning capabilities for agents to improve over time
- Develop a visual interface for monitoring and managing the agent-driven development process
- Explore integration with version control systems and CI/CD pipelines
- Investigate the use of federated learning for collaborative agent improvement

## Conclusion

The proposed Agent-Driven Development Framework will significantly enhance our current provider/model infrastructure by introducing a more autonomous and specialized approach to AI-assisted development. This system will allow for greater flexibility, improved task management, and more efficient utilization of our AI resources. By implementing this framework, we can create a more robust and scalable development process that leverages the strengths of various AI models and human expertise.
