# RFC-013: Implementation of Comprehensive Monitoring System for AI-Assisted Development

## Status
Proposed

## Context
Our AI-assisted software development environment requires a robust monitoring system to track performance, identify issues, and ensure high-quality output across multiple projects. We need to implement a system that can handle metrics from thousands of projects while providing actionable insights.

## Decision
We propose implementing a comprehensive monitoring system based on Prometheus and Grafana, with a custom metrics simulator for testing and development purposes.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Metrics Collection
- Use Prometheus as the primary metrics collection and storage system.
- Implement custom exporters for our AI agents and development processes.
- Utilize the `prometheus_client` library in Python for easy integration with our existing codebase.

### 2. Metrics Categories
- RFC Processing Metrics
- Implementation Task Metrics
- Code Review Metrics
- Testing Metrics
- DORA Metrics (Deployment Frequency, Lead Time for Changes, Time to Restore Service, Change Failure Rate)
- SLO/SLI Metrics (Availability, Latency, Error Rate)

### 3. Metrics Simulator
- Develop a Python-based metrics simulator using the `stochastic` library for realistic data generation.
- Simulate metrics for 1000 projects to test scalability.
- Include normal operations and problem scenarios for comprehensive testing.

### 4. Visualization
- Use Grafana for creating dashboards and visualizing metrics.
- Implement dashboards for:
  - Overall system health
  - DORA metrics
  - SLO/SLI tracking
  - Project-specific performance
  - Top performing projects

### 5. Alerting
- Set up Grafana alerting for SLO breaches and critical threshold violations.
- Integrate with existing notification systems (e.g., Slack, PagerDuty).

### 6. Infrastructure
- Deploy Prometheus and Grafana using Docker containers for easy scaling and management.
- Use docker-compose for local development and testing.

### 7. Security
- Implement secure access to Grafana dashboards using existing authentication systems.
- Ensure metrics data is encrypted at rest and in transit.

## Alternatives Considered

1. **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)**
   - Pros: Powerful log analysis, flexible visualization
   - Cons: Higher resource requirements, steeper learning curve

2. **Custom-built monitoring solution**
   - Pros: Tailored to our specific needs
   - Cons: Time-consuming to develop, potential reliability issues

3. **Cloud-based monitoring services (e.g., Datadog, New Relic)**
   - Pros: Managed service, extensive features
   - Cons: Higher cost, potential vendor lock-in

## Rationale
The proposed Prometheus/Grafana solution offers a good balance of flexibility, scalability, and ease of implementation. It integrates well with our existing Docker-based infrastructure and allows for future expansion. The open-source nature of these tools also aligns with our development philosophy.

## Implications
- Development time required for implementing custom exporters and setting up infrastructure
- Learning curve for team members not familiar with Prometheus and Grafana
- Ongoing maintenance and potential scalability challenges as the number of projects grows

## Open Questions
1. How will this monitoring system integrate with our existing CI/CD pipelines?
2. What is the expected resource utilization of Prometheus at our projected scale?
3. Should we consider implementing a time-series database (e.g., InfluxDB) for long-term metric storage?
