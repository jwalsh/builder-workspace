# RFC 003: Monitoring Setup

## Introduction

This RFC proposes a monitoring setup for our Project Manager application using Prometheus, Node Exporter, and Grafana.

## Monitoring Components

### Prometheus

Configuration:

```yaml
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'node'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9100']

  - job_name: 'project_manager'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:8000']  # Assuming Project Manager exposes metrics on port 8000
```

### Node Exporter

Used for collecting system-level metrics.

### Grafana

Create a Grafana dashboard to visualize:
- System metrics (CPU, memory, disk usage)
- Project Manager specific metrics (task count, processing time, etc.)
- Ollama performance metrics

## Implementation in Project Manager

Update `project_manager.py` to include metrics collection:

```python
from prometheus_client import start_http_server, Counter, Gauge

# Metrics
task_counter = Counter('project_manager_tasks_total', 'Total number of tasks processed')
processing_time = Gauge('project_manager_processing_time_seconds', 'Time taken to process a task')

def main():
    start_http_server(8000)  # Start metrics server
    # ... rest of the main function
```

## Next Steps

1. Set up the monitoring stack (Prometheus, Node Exporter, Grafana).
2. Implement metrics collection in the Project Manager application.
3. Create Grafana dashboards for visualizing the collected metrics.
4. Update the project documentation to include monitoring instructions.
5. Conduct testing to ensure accurate metric collection and visualization.g
