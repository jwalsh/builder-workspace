# RFC 001: Deployment Options

## Introduction

This RFC proposes options for deploying our Project Manager application, considering various scenarios including local development, containerized environments, and cloud/bare metal systems.

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Run Directly on Laptop

This option involves running the Project Manager and Ollama directly on the host machine.

#### Setup

1. Install Python and create a virtual environment
2. Install Ollama on the host machine
3. Run the Project Manager script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
curl https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh
python project_manager.py
```

#### Pros
- Simplest setup
- Direct access to host resources and file system
- Easy to monitor and debug

#### Cons
- Less isolated environment
- Potential conflicts with other Python projects
- Manual setup required for each new machine

### Option 2: Run in Docker Container

This option involves running both the Project Manager and Ollama within Docker containers.

#### Docker Compose Configuration

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  project_manager:
    build: .
    volumes:
      - .:/app
      - ./secrets.json:/app/secrets.json
    depends_on:
      - ollama
    environment:
      - OLLAMA_API_BASE_URL=http://ollama:11434

  ollama:
    image: ollama/ollama
    volumes:
      - ./ollama_data:/root/.ollama
```

#### Pros
- Consistent environment across different machines
- Easy to scale and deploy
- Includes monitoring setup

#### Cons
- Requires Docker knowledge
- Slightly more resource-intensive

### Option 3: Run on Cloud/Bare Metal with Monitoring

This option involves deploying the Project Manager and Ollama on a cloud or bare metal server with monitoring.

#### Setup Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Install dependencies
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y python3 python3-venv python3-pip prometheus node_exporter grafana

# Set up Python environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install Ollama
curl https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh

# Start monitoring services
sudo systemctl start prometheus
sudo systemctl start node_exporter
sudo systemctl start grafana-server

# Run Project Manager
python project_manager.py
```

#### Pros
- Full control over the environment
- Suitable for production deployments
- Includes robust monitoring

#### Cons
- Requires server management skills
- More complex setup

## Recommendation

For development and personal use, Option 1 (running directly on the laptop) provides the simplest setup and easiest access to local project files and environments.

For team development or light production use, Option 2 (Docker containers) offers a good balance of consistency and ease of deployment.

For full production deployment, Option 3 (cloud/bare metal with monitoring) provides the most control and scalability.

## Next Steps

1. Implement the chosen option in the project.
2. Update the project documentation to reflect the chosen setup.
3. Conduct thorough testing in the target environment.
4. Create a runbook for common operational tasks and troubleshooting.
