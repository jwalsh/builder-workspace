* RFC 002: Multilingual Story Generation and Analysis Simulator
:PROPERTIES:
:RFC_NUMBER: 002
:STATUS: DRAFT
:AUTHOR: backend-developer
:DATE: [2024-09-19 Thu]
:END:

** Overview
This RFC proposes the development of a proof-of-concept (POC) simulator for the MultilinguaStoryForge platform. The simulator will demonstrate the core functionalities of story generation, speech synthesis, transcription, and analysis in multiple languages.

** Purpose
The simulator will serve as a tool to:
1. Validate the system architecture
2. Test integration of various AWS services
3. Identify potential challenges in multilingual story processing
4. Provide a working example for team members

** Key Features
1. Multilingual story generation using AWS Bedrock
2. Speech synthesis using Amazon Polly
3. Audio transcription using Amazon Transcribe
4. Basic story analysis (sentiment, key phrases) using Amazon Comprehend
5. Translation between languages using Amazon Translate

** Implementation Details
The simulator will be implemented as a Python script named =multilingual_story_simulator.py= located in the =utils= directory of our project structure.

#+begin_src python :tangle simulator.py
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Multilingual Story Simulator: Generate, synthesize, and analyze stories in multiple languages.

This script uses AWS services to generate stories in multiple languages,
convert them to speech, transcribe them back to text, and perform analysis
on the generated and transcribed stories.

** AWS Services Integration
The simulator will integrate with the following AWS services:
1. AWS Bedrock for story generation
2. Amazon Polly for speech synthesis
3. Amazon Transcribe for speech-to-text conversion
4. Amazon Translate for translation between languages
5. Amazon Comprehend for basic story analysis
6. Amazon S3 for temporary storage of audio files

** Workflow
1. Generate a story in the primary language using AWS Bedrock
2. Translate the story to other specified languages
3. Synthesize speech for each language version using Amazon Polly
4. Transcribe the audio back to text using Amazon Transcribe
5. Analyze the original and transcribed texts using Amazon Comprehend
6. Compare the original and transcribed texts for accuracy
7. Generate a report with results and metrics

** Output
The simulator will produce the following outputs in the specified directory:
1. Original generated stories (text files)
2. Translated stories (text files)
3. Synthesized audio files (mp3 format)
4. Transcribed texts (text files)
5. Analysis results (JSON format)
6. Comparison report (HTML or Markdown format)

** Next Steps
1. Review and approve this RFC
2. Implement the simulator script
3. Test with various languages and story types
4. Use insights from the simulator to refine the overall system architecture
5. Integrate simulator into the CI/CD pipeline for ongoing testing

** Questions and Considerations
1. Should we include error handling and retry mechanisms for AWS service calls?
2. How should we handle rate limiting and service quotas?
3. Should we implement a caching mechanism for generated stories and translations?
4. How can we make the simulator easily extensible for future enhancements?
