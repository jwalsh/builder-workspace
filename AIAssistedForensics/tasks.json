This should include the types of data sources to be analyzed (e.g., disk images, network traffic logs, email archives, mobile device data, cloud storage data, etc.), the desired outputs or evidence to be identified (e.g., malware signatures, suspicious file transfers, communication patterns, data exfiltration attempts, etc.), the performance and scalability requirements (e.g., ability to handle petabytes of data, parallel processing capabilities, distributed computing infrastructure, etc.), any relevant legal or regulatory constraints (e.g., data privacy laws, chain of custody requirements, admissibility of evidence in court, etc.), the expected integration points with existing forensics tools or workflows, and the desired user interface and reporting capabilities.",
