    "title": "System Architecture Design",
    "description": "Design the overall system architecture, including components, data flows, and integration points. The architecture should consider the following key aspects:\n\n1. Device compatibility: The system should support various AR-enabled devices (e.g., smartphones, tablets, AR headsets) and handle different hardware capabilities. Consider a modular design that separates device-specific logic from core functionality.\n\n2. Data management: Implement a centralized data storage solution (e.g., cloud-based database) for construction data and user data. Ensure data integrity, backup, and recovery mechanisms.\n\n3. Real-time data processing: Utilize edge computing or serverless architectures for low-latency processing of sensor data. Consider offloading computationally intensive tasks to cloud resources.\n\n4. Scalability and performance: Adopt a microservices architecture with load balancing and auto-scaling capabilities. Implement caching and content delivery networks (CDNs) for improved performance.\n\n5. Integration with existing systems: Expose APIs or use industry-standard protocols (e.g., IFC, BCF) for integration with construction management software, BIM tools, and other relevant systems.\n\n6. Security and privacy: Implement secure authentication and authorization mechanisms. Encrypt data in transit and at rest. Adhere to relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).\n\n7. Offline mode: Consider supporting an offline mode for situations with limited or no internet connectivity, with local data caching and synchronization mechanisms.\n\n8. Extensibility and maintainability: Design a modular and extensible architecture that allows for easy integration of new features, devices, and data sources. Follow industry best practices for code organization, documentation, and testing.",
